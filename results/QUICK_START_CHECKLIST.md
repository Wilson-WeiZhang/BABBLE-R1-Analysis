## üíå STEP 5: RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS (6-8 hours)

### Reviewer 1

- [ ] **Comment 1.1** (Terminology):
  ```
  We thank the reviewer for this important observation. We have revised
  terminology throughout, replacing "interpersonal neural coupling" with
  "infant neural alignment with adult neural activity" to accurately
  reflect that adult EEG was pre-recorded. Changes made in: [list sections].
  ```

- [ ] **Comment 1.2** (GPDC comparisons):
  ```
  Following the reviewer's suggestion, we performed direct between-condition
  GPDC comparisons. AI connectivity was significantly stronger in Full gaze
  vs. Partial (Z=X.XX, q=.XXX) and No gaze (Z=X.XX, q<.001). Added to
  Results Section 2.2 and Supplementary Table S9.
  ```

- [ ] **Comment 1.3** (Statistical details):
  ```
  We apologize for incomplete reporting. The df=98 reflected trial-level
  analysis; we now report block-averaged participant-level analysis (df=41-46)
  as primary results, with complete statistics added throughout (exact p, q,
  d, CI). See Supplementary Table S8 and revised Methods section.
  ```

### Reviewer 2

- [ ] **Major Issue 2.1** (Omnibus test):
  ```
  We now report hierarchical testing: omnibus LME first (F(2,120)=X.XX, p=.XXX),
  then post-hocs, then within-condition tests. See revised Results 2.1.
  ```

- [ ] **Major Issue 2.2** (df=98):
  ```
  [Same response as R1.3] Block-averaged analysis with proper df now primary.
  ```

- [ ] **Major Issue 2.3** (Incomplete statistics):
  ```
  All analyses now include: exact p, FDR-corrected q, effect sizes, and 95% CI.
  Created Supplementary Tables S8-S9 with complete statistics. Revised Methods
  section describes all procedures in detail.
  ```

- [ ] **Major Issue 2.4** (Circular mediation):
  ```
  To address circularity concerns, we conducted split-half cross-validation
  (100 iterations): PLS derived on training sets, mediation tested on test sets.
  Effect remained significant (mean Œ≤=X.XX, 95% CI[X,Y]), confirming robustness.
  See Supplementary Section [X].
  ```

- [ ] **Major Issue 2.5** (Systematic reporting):
  ```
  [Same as 2.3] Complete statistics now reported systematically throughout.
  ```

- [ ] **Major Issue 2.6** (Terminology):
  ```
  [Same as R1.1] Terminology revised throughout manuscript.
  ```

### Reviewer 3
- [ ] Address any minor comments
- [ ] Reference updated statistics/tables where relevant

## üéØ PRIORITY LABELS

Throughout this checklist:
- üî¥ CRITICAL: Must be done, directly addresses major reviewer concerns
- üü° IMPORTANT: Strongly recommended, significantly strengthens manuscript
- üü¢ STRENGTHENING: Optional but valuable, demonstrates thoroughness

**Minimum for acceptance:** Complete all üî¥ CRITICAL items
**Recommended for strong acceptance:** Complete üî¥ + üü° items
**Ideal for outstanding revision:** Complete all üî¥ + üü° + üü¢ items

---

## üí° TIPS FOR SUCCESS

1. **Work sequentially**: Don't skip steps
2. **Double-check statistics**: Verify values make sense before inserting
3. **Keep backups**: Save versions as you go
4. **Get co-author input**: Especially on tone/style choices
5. **Read aloud**: Helps catch awkward phrasing
6. **Use track changes**: Makes reviewer's job easier
7. **Be thorough**: Better to over-document than under-document
8. **Stay positive**: Your findings are solid, this is just better reporting!

## üìû IF YOU GET STUCK

**Issue:** Script won't run
**Solution:** Check file paths, ensure all data files present

**Issue:** Don't know which option to choose
**Solution:** See decision trees in `R1_MANUSCRIPT_REVISION_OPTIONS.md`

**Issue:** Statistics look weird
**Solution:** Verify data files haven't been modified, check sample sizes

**Issue:** Running out of time
**Solution:** Focus on üî¥ CRITICAL items first, defer üü¢ STRENGTHENING if needed

**Issue:** Reviewer asks follow-up questions
**Solution:** You have sensitivity analyses ready to address most concerns
