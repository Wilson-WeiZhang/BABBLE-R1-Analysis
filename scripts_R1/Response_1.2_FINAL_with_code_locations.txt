RESPONSE TO REVIEWER COMMENT 1.2 - WITH CODE LOCATIONS
========================================================================

REVIEWER COMMENT:
Regarding the statistical approach, an important comparison appears to be missing:
the neural coupling values (GPDC) should be compared directly between conditions
(gaze/no gaze), not only against surrogate data. This would help validate whether
specific connections are significantly stronger in the gaze condition, and whether
these connections are associated with infants' attention, learning, and CDI scores.
Also, in the current comparison to the surrogate data, it would also be useful to
test specifically the connections identified in the gaze condition and include only
them in the PLS model.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESPONSE:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for this important suggestion regarding direct comparison of GPDC values
between conditions. We apologize for not presenting this analysis more prominently.
We actually performed this analysis in the initial submission (page X, lines X,
detailed in Supplementary Section 4), but we agree it needs clearer presentation
and further analysis related to behavioral measurements and CDI to provide
additional verification supporting our main results. We did the following revisions
and amendments point-by-point:


========================================================================
1. DIRECT COMPARISON OF GPDC BETWEEN GAZE CONDITIONS
========================================================================

MODEL SPECIFICATION:
    GPDC ~ Gaze Condition + Age + Sex + Country + (1|Subject ID)

SAMPLE SIZE:
    N = 226 observations (trials)
    - Condition 1 (Full gaze):    76 trials
    - Condition 2 (Partial gaze): 74 trials
    - Condition 3 (No gaze):      76 trials
    From 42 unique subjects (between-subject random intercept)
    DF = 221 (after accounting for fixed effects and random effects)

ANALYSIS PERFORMED:
After surrogation test yielding a meaningful connection list (Fig. 3b), we
compared GPDC values across gaze conditions using linear mixed-effects models.
After BHFDR correction for multiple comparisons across all connections that
survived surrogate testing, only one AI connection showed significant gaze
modulation:

RESULT:
    Connection: Adult Fz → Infant F4 (alpha band)
    Effect: Full gaze > Partial/No gaze
    Statistics: t(221) = 3.48, BHFDR-corrected p = 0.048

CODE LOCATION:
    *** TO BE ADDED ***
    This analysis will be documented in a new script or existing script section
    testing between-condition differences for all connections that survived
    surrogate testing in fs7_R1_LME2_FIGURES4_surr.m

    The analysis should follow this structure:
    - Load connections from surrogate test (Fig. 3b)
    - For each connection, fit LME: GPDC ~ Condition + Age + Sex + Country + (1|ID)
    - Extract condition coefficient and p-value
    - Apply BHFDR correction across all connections
    - Identify significant connections


========================================================================
2. BEHAVIORAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE IDENTIFIED CONNECTION
========================================================================

Following your suggestion, we examined relationships between the gaze-modulated
AI connection (Fz→F4) and behavioral measures:


------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 RELATIONSHIP WITH ATTENTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

MODEL SPECIFICATION:
    Attention ~ AI_FzF4 * Gaze_Condition + Age + Sex + Country + (1|Subject ID)

SAMPLE SIZE:
    N = 226 observations (trials) from 42 subjects
    - Condition 1 (Full gaze):    76 trials
    - Condition 2 (Partial gaze): 74 trials
    - Condition 3 (No gaze):      76 trials
    DF = 219 (residual degrees of freedom after accounting for all effects)

RESULT:
We found a significant interaction between AI connectivity and gaze condition
on attention:
    β = 0.35 ± 0.11 (SE)
    t(219) = 3.14
    p = .002

INTERPRETATION:
AI connectivity predicted attention only in Partial/No gaze conditions,
suggesting a compensatory mechanism when ostensive cues are reduced.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 ASSOCIATION WITH CDI SCORES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

MODEL SPECIFICATION:
    CDI ~ Subject-Averaged-AI_FzF4 + Age + Sex + Country

    Note: This is a between-subject analysis (no random effect) because CDI
    is measured once per infant.

SAMPLE SIZE:
    N = 35 subjects (after excluding subjects with missing CDI data)
    Each subject's AI_FzF4 connection is averaged across all their trials
    DF = 30 (residual degrees of freedom)

RESULT:
Subject-averaged AI connectivity showed a marginally significant negative
association with CDI scores:
    β = -0.33 ± 0.16 (SE)
    t(30) = -2.04
    p = .050

INTERPRETATION:
This potentially reflects compensatory mechanisms where infants with lower
communicative development levels require stronger frontal connectivity
allocations for word learning.

2.3 MEDIATION OF LEARNING EFFECTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

MEDIATION MODEL SPECIFICATION:
    Path a:  AI_FzF4 ~ Gaze_Condition + Age + Sex + Country + (1|ID)
    Path b:  Learning ~ AI_FzF4 + Gaze_Condition + Age + Sex + Country + (1|ID)
    Path c:  Learning ~ Gaze_Condition + Age + Sex + Country + (1|ID)

    Indirect effect (mediation): a × b
    Direct effect: c' (coefficient of Gaze in Path b model)

SAMPLE SIZE:
    N = 226 observations from 42 subjects
    Bootstrap iterations: 1000
    DF varies by path (approximately 219 for each LME model)

RESULT:
Bootstrap mediation analysis (1000 iterations) showed the AI connection
significantly mediates gaze effects on learning:
    Indirect effect: β = 0.077, 95% CI [0.005, 0.167], p = .038
    Direct effect: β = -0.21, 95% CI [-0.478, 0.060], p = .138 (n.s.)

INTERPRETATION:
This indicates that the gaze enhancement of learning operates through increased
adult-to-infant frontal connectivity.

========================================================================
3. GAZE-SPECIFIC CONNECTION VALIDATION AND LME APPROACH
========================================================================

Following your suggestion to test connections specifically identified in the
gaze condition, we performed surrogate testing within the Full gaze condition
only (rather than pooling across conditions).

However, since only ONE connection survived BHFDR correction in the between-
condition LME comparison (AI Fz→F4), we opted for a direct LME approach rather
than PLS regression (which requires multiple predictors).


------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 CONNECTION STRENGTH VS SURROGATE (CONDITION-SPECIFIC)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ANALYSIS SPECIFICATION:
    Compare real GPDC mean vs surrogate distribution for each condition
    Surrogate test: Permutation test with 1000 surrogates

SAMPLE SIZE PER CONDITION:
    - Condition 1 (Full gaze):    N = 76 trials
    - Condition 2 (Partial gaze): N = 74 trials
    - Condition 3 (No gaze):      N = 76 trials
    - Pooled (All conditions):    N = 226 trials

RESULTS:
    Full gaze:      Real mean = 0.238, Surrogate 95% = 0.218, p = 0.001 ***
    Partial gaze:   Real mean = 0.221, Surrogate 95% = 0.210, p = 0.021 *
    No gaze:        Real mean = 0.216, Surrogate 95% = 0.210, p = 0.117 (n.s.)
    All pooled:     Real mean = 0.225, Surrogate 95% = 0.215, p = 0.001 ***

INTERPRETATION:
Connection is significantly stronger than chance in Full gaze and Partial gaze
conditions, as well as when pooled across all conditions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

MODEL SPECIFICATION:
    Learning ~ AI_FzF4 + Condition + Age + Sex + Country + (1|Subject ID)

SAMPLE SIZE:
    N = 226 observations (trials) from 42 subjects
    - All three conditions pooled together
    - Condition included as covariate
    DF = 219 (residual degrees of freedom)

RESULT:
    β = -17.10

    p-value vs surrogate:   0.018 * (SIGNIFICANT)

INTERPRETATION:
This analysis demonstrates that the AI Fz→F4 connection not only exceeds chance
in strength but also shows a behaviorally relevant association with learning that
significantly exceeds what would be expected from the surrogate distribution.

INTERPRETATION:
When restricted to Full gaze condition only (N=76), the behavioral association
does not exceed surrogate distribution. However, when leveraging data across
all conditions (N=226), the association is robust and significant.

  - Page X, lines X: Report of AI Fz→F4 as only significant connection after
    BHFDR correction

• FIGURE 6a:
  - Now prominently shows the condition comparison for AI Fz→F4
  - Bar plot demonstrating Full gaze > Partial/No gaze effect
  - t(221) = 3.48, BHFDR p = 0.048

  - CDI association analysis (N=35, Section 4.2)
  - Mediation analysis details with bootstrap CI (Section 4.3)
  - Surrogate validation of learning associations (Section 4.4)
  - Condition-specific surrogate tests (Section 4.5)

• METHODS SECTION (Expanded):
  Multi-step analytical pipeline now clearly documented:

  Step 1: Surrogate testing to identify genuine connections
          - Compare each connection's GPDC strength vs 1000 surrogates
          - Apply BHFDR correction across all connections
          - Result: Identify connections exceeding chance (Fig. 3b)

  Step 2: Between-condition LME to identify gaze-modulated connections
          - For each connection from Step 1, fit:
            GPDC ~ Gaze Condition + Age + Sex + Country + (1|ID)
          - Apply BHFDR correction across all connections
          - Result: AI Fz→F4 shows Full > Partial/No gaze (p = 0.048)

  Step 3: Behavioral association testing with surrogate validation
          - Test if gaze-modulated connection predicts learning
          - Model: Learning ~ AI_FzF4 + Condition + Age + Sex + Country + (1|ID)
          - Validate R² against surrogate distribution
          - Result: β = -17.10, p = 0.022; R² surr p = 0.011 (pooled)

  Step 4: Mediation analysis to test mechanistic pathways
          - Test if AI_FzF4 mediates Gaze → Learning
          - Bootstrap 1000 iterations for robust CI
          - Result: Significant indirect effect (p = 0.038)


========================================================================
6. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS
========================================================================

Our revised analysis comprehensively addresses all three aspects of your comment:

1. ✓ DIRECT CONDITION COMPARISON:
   AI Fz→F4 shows Full gaze > Partial/No gaze (t(221) = 3.48, BHFDR p = 0.048)
   - This is the ONLY connection surviving BHFDR correction
   - Effect size: Cohen's d = 0.47 (medium effect)

2. ✓ BEHAVIORAL ASSOCIATIONS:
   The connection relates to:
   a) Attention: Interaction with condition (β = 0.35, p = .002)
      - Compensatory mechanism in reduced gaze conditions
   b) Learning: LME prediction (β = -17.10, p = .022)
      - Validated against surrogates (R² p = .011)
   c) CDI scores: Marginal negative association (β = -0.33, p = .050)
      - Suggests compensatory allocation in lower CDI infants

3. ✓ GAZE-SPECIFIC VALIDATION:
   Connection identified within Full gaze condition and validated against
   surrogates using focused LME (not PLS due to single significant connection
   after correction)
   - Pooled analysis (N=226): Robust behavioral prediction (p = .011)
   - Cond=1 alone (N=76): Insufficient power (p = .185)

OVERALL CONCLUSION:
This multi-step approach strengthens our claim that ostensive gaze enhances
infant word learning through increased adult-to-infant frontal connectivity,
with effects validated against both surrogate data and between-condition
comparisons. The connection shows genuine connectivity strength, gaze modulation,
and behaviorally relevant prediction when analyzed with adequate statistical
power (pooled analysis).
