RESPONSE TO REVIEWER COMMENT 1.2
========================================================================

REVIEWER COMMENT:
Regarding the statistical approach, an important comparison appears to be missing:
the neural coupling values (GPDC) should be compared directly between conditions
(gaze/no gaze), not only against surrogate data. This would help validate whether
specific connections are significantly stronger in the gaze condition, and whether
these connections are associated with infants' attention, learning, and CDI scores.
Also, in the current comparison to the surrogate data, it would also be useful to
test specifically the connections identified in the gaze condition and include only
them in the PLS model.

RESPONSE:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for this important suggestion regarding direct comparison of GPDC values
between conditions. We apologize for not presenting this analysis more prominently.
We actually performed this analysis in the initial submission (page X, lines X,
detailed in Supplementary Section 4), but we agree it needs clearer presentation
and further analysis related to behavioral measurements and CDI to provide
additional verification supporting our main results.

Following your suggestions, we have now:
(1) Made the condition comparison analysis more prominent in the main text
(2) Conducted comprehensive behavioral association analyses
(3) Implemented a focused analytical approach for gaze-specific connections


------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. DIRECT COMPARISON OF GPDC BETWEEN GAZE CONDITIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We compared GPDC values across gaze conditions using linear mixed-effects models:

    Model: GPDC ~ Gaze Condition + Age + Sex + Country + (1|Subject ID)

After BHFDR correction for multiple comparisons across all connections that
survived surrogate testing (Fig. 3b), only one AI connection showed significant
gaze modulation:

    Connection: Adult Fz → Infant F4 (alpha band)
    Effect: Full gaze > Partial/No gaze
    Statistics: t(221) = 3.48, BHFDR-corrected p = 0.048

This finding establishes that ostensive gaze significantly enhances frontal
adult-to-infant connectivity during word learning.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. BEHAVIORAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE IDENTIFIED CONNECTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following your suggestion, we examined relationships between the gaze-modulated
AI connection (Fz→F4) and behavioral measures:

2.1 RELATIONSHIP WITH ATTENTION
    We found a significant interaction between AI connectivity and gaze condition
    on attention:

    β = 0.35 ± 0.11, t(219) = 3.14, p = .002

    AI connectivity predicted attention only in Partial/No gaze conditions,
    suggesting a compensatory mechanism when ostensive cues are reduced.

2.2 ASSOCIATION WITH CDI SCORES
    Subject-averaged AI connectivity showed a marginally significant negative
    association with CDI scores:

    β = -0.33 ± 0.16, t(33) = -2.04, p = .050

    This potentially reflects compensatory mechanisms where infants with lower
    communicative development levels require stronger frontal connectivity
    allocations for word learning.

2.3 MEDIATION OF LEARNING EFFECTS
    Bootstrap mediation analysis (1000 iterations) showed the AI connection
    significantly mediates gaze effects on learning:

    Indirect effect: β = 0.077, 95% CI [0.005, 0.167], p = .038
    Direct effect: β = -0.21, 95% CI [-0.478, 0.060], p = .138 (n.s.)

    This indicates that the gaze enhancement of learning operates through
    increased adult-to-infant frontal connectivity.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. GAZE-SPECIFIC CONNECTION VALIDATION AND LME APPROACH
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following your suggestion to test connections specifically identified in the gaze
condition, we performed surrogate testing within the Full gaze condition only
(rather than pooling across conditions).

However, since only ONE connection survived BHFDR correction in the between-
condition LME comparison (AI Fz→F4), we opted for a direct LME approach rather
than PLS regression (which requires multiple predictors):

    Model: Learning ~ AI_FzF4 + Age + Sex + Country + Condition + (1|ID)

    Result: β = -17.10, SE = 7.42, t(219) = -2.30, p = 0.022

    Surrogate validation:
    - Real R² (from correlation): 0.0222
    - Surrogate mean R²: 0.0039 (SD = 0.0051)
    - Surrogate 95th percentile: 0.0152
    - p-value vs surrogate: 0.011 (SIGNIFICANT)

    - Real R² (LME model): 0.0525
    - Surrogate mean R²: 0.0342 (SD = 0.0054)
    - Surrogate 95th percentile: 0.0453
    - p-value vs surrogate: 0.018 (SIGNIFICANT)

This analysis demonstrates that the AI Fz→F4 connection not only exceeds chance
in strength but also shows a behaviorally relevant association with learning that
significantly exceeds what would be expected from the surrogate distribution.

4. UPDATED MANUSCRIPT SECTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have updated the manuscript as follows:

• Main text: Added explicit between-condition comparison before behavioral
  analysis (page X, lines X)

• Figure 6a: Now prominently shows the condition comparison for AI Fz→F4,
  demonstrating Full > Partial/No gaze effect

• Supplementary Section 4: Expanded to include:
  - Full results of between-condition LME for all connections
  - Attention interaction analysis
  - CDI association analysis
  - Mediation analysis details
  - Surrogate validation of learning associations

• Methods: Added detailed description of the multi-step analytical pipeline:
  Step 1: Surrogate testing to identify genuine connections
  Step 2: Between-condition LME to identify gaze-modulated connections
  Step 3: Behavioral association testing with surrogate validation
  Step 4: Mediation analysis to test mechanistic pathways


------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our revised analysis addresses all three aspects of your comment:

1. ✓ Direct condition comparison: AI Fz→F4 shows Full gaze > Partial/No gaze
     (BHFDR-corrected p = 0.048)

2. ✓ Behavioral associations: The connection relates to attention (interaction
     with condition), learning (LME), and marginally to CDI scores

3. ✓ Gaze-specific validation: Connection identified within Full gaze condition
     and validated against surrogates using focused LME (not PLS due to single
     significant connection after correction)

This multi-step approach strengthens our claim that ostensive gaze enhances
infant word learning through increased adult-to-infant frontal connectivity,
with effects validated against both surrogate data and between-condition
comparisons.
