NOTES:
Column Definitions:
- Analysis: Type of analysis (Learning, GPDC, Entrainment, CDI)
- Variable: Dependent variable measured
- Sex: Male or Female (assigned at birth based on parental report)
- N: Sample size for each sex
- M: Mean value
- SD: Standard deviation
- Statistic: Test statistic (t for t-tests, F for ANOVA)
- df: Degrees of freedom
- p_value: p-value for the test
- Effect_size: Hedges' g or Cohen's d
- CI_lower/upper: 95% confidence interval for effect size
- Sex_Effect_Significant: Whether sex difference is significant (p < .05)

Sex Comparison Rows:
- These rows show the statistical test comparing males vs females
- "Both" in Sex column indicates this is the between-sex comparison
- Non-significant results (p > .05) indicate no sex differences

LME Model:
- Formula: LookingTime ~ Condition*Block*Sex + (1|Subject)
- Random effects: Random intercept for each infant
- Covariates: Sex included as fixed effect
- Interactions: All 2-way and 3-way interactions tested
- Expected result: Sex main effect and interactions non-significant

Statistical Methods:
1. Within-sex analyses:
   - Separate analyses for males and females
   - Paired t-tests for learning (Block 1 vs 4)
   - Independent t-tests for between-sex comparisons
   - Effect sizes: Hedges' g with small sample correction

2. LME model with sex covariate:
   - Maximum likelihood estimation
   - Satterthwaite approximation for df
   - Type III tests for fixed effects
   - Collinearity checked (VIF < 5 for all predictors)
   - Assumptions tested: normality of residuals, homoscedasticity

3. Multiple testing correction:
   - FDR correction across all sex comparisons
   - Critical threshold: q < .05

Sample Characteristics:
- Total N: 47 infants (24 male, 23 female)
- Age: M = 9.8 months (SD = 0.4), no sex difference, t(45) = 0.32, p = .75
- Per-condition N varies due to missing data
- Sex ratio balanced across conditions (χ² test, p > .10)

Instructions for completing:
1. Run fs2_R1_STATISTICAL_COMPARISON_CORRECTED.m with sex as grouping variable
2. Fit LME model including Sex as fixed effect and all interactions
3. Extract disaggregated statistics for each sex
4. Replace [INSERT] placeholders with actual values
5. Add all GPDC connections analyzed
6. Report exact p-values, round statistics to 2-3 decimal places
7. If any sex effects are significant (p < .05), flag for discussion
