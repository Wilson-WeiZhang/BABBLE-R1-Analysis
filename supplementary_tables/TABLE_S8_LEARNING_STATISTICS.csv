NOTES:
Column definitions:
- Condition: Experimental condition (Full/No/Averted speaker gaze)
- Block: Comparison blocks (1→4 indicates learning from Block 1 to Block 4)
- N: Sample size (number of infants with valid data in this condition)
- M_Block1: Mean looking time in Block 1 (seconds)
- SD_Block1: Standard deviation of looking time in Block 1
- M_Block4: Mean looking time in Block 4 (seconds)
- SD_Block4: Standard deviation of looking time in Block 4
- M_diff: Mean difference score (Block4 - Block1)
- SD_diff: Standard deviation of difference scores
- t: t-statistic from paired-samples t-test
- df: Degrees of freedom (N-1)
- p_uncorrected: Uncorrected p-value from t-test
- q_FDR: FDR-corrected q-value using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure
- Hedges_g: Effect size (Hedges' g with small sample correction)
- CI_lower: Lower bound of 95% bootstrap confidence interval for Hedges' g
- CI_upper: Upper bound of 95% bootstrap confidence interval for Hedges' g
- Learning_Significant: Whether learning was statistically significant (q < .05)

Statistical Methods:
1. Paired-samples t-tests comparing Block 1 vs Block 4 looking times
2. FDR correction using Benjamini-Hochberg method (3 comparisons)
3. Effect sizes calculated as Hedges' g with correction factor J = 1 - 3/(4*df - 1)
4. Bootstrap confidence intervals (5000 iterations, percentile method)
5. Assumptions tested: normality (Shapiro-Wilk/Lilliefors), outliers (3*IQR)

Exclusions:
- Infants with missing data in either Block 1 or Block 4 excluded from that condition
- Outliers (>3*IQR) excluded before analysis
- Total sample: N=47 infants, per-condition N varies due to missing data

Instructions for completing:
1. Run fs2_R1_STATISTICAL_COMPARISON_CORRECTED.m
2. Extract values from output structure stats.learning
3. Replace [INSERT] placeholders with actual values
4. Round to 2 decimal places for means/SDs, 3 for statistics
5. Report exact p-values down to p=.001, then p<.001
