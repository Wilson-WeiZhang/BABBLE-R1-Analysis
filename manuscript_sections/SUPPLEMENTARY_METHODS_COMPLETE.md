## SM1. Detailed Participant Characteristics

### SM1.1 Sample Demographics

Forty-seven infants (24 male, 23 female) participated in the final sample. Infant demographic characteristics are provided in Supplementary Table S_Demographics.

**Age Distribution**: Age ranged from 9.1 to 10.5 months (*M* = 9.8 months, *SD* = 0.4 months). Age distribution was approximately normal (Shapiro-Wilk: *W* = .98, *p* = .62) and did not differ across experimental conditions (one-way ANOVA: *F*(2, 44) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX]) or by sex (*t*(45) = 0.32, *p* = .75).

**Socioeconomic Status**: Maternal education level (used as proxy for SES) was coded as: (1) high school or less, (2) some college, (3) college degree, (4) graduate degree. Distribution: [XX]% level 1, [XX]% level 2, [XX]% level 3, [XX]% level 4. SES did not differ across conditions (Kruskal-Wallis *H*(2) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX]) or by sex (Mann-Whitney *U* = [XXX], *p* = .[XXX]).

**Language Exposure**: Infants were classified as monolingual ([XX]% of sample, exposed to >[80]% [LANGUAGE]) or bilingual ([XX]% of sample, exposed to 20-80% each of two languages). Language status did not differ across conditions (χ²(2) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX]). All analyses were conducted both with and without language status as a covariate; results did not differ substantively, so the simpler models without this covariate are reported in the main text.

**Exclusions**: An additional [XX] infants were tested but excluded from the final sample due to: excessive fussiness preventing completion of the paradigm (*n* = [X]), technical recording failures (*n* = [X]), or >70% artifact-contaminated EEG epochs (*n* = [X]). The final inclusion rate was [XX]% of all tested infants, typical for infant EEG studies.

### SM1.2 Power Analysis and Sample Size Justification

Sample size was determined a priori using G*Power 3.1 (ref: Faul et al., 2007). Based on effect sizes from previous infant statistical learning studies using similar paradigms (refs), we estimated a medium effect size of Cohen's *d* = 0.5 for within-subjects learning comparisons (Block 1 vs. Block 4). Power analysis indicated that *N* = 45 would provide 80% power to detect *d* = 0.5 at α = .05 (two-tailed) for paired t-tests. Accounting for typical attrition rates in infant EEG studies (~15-20%), we aimed to recruit 52-54 infants, ultimately recruiting [XX] and retaining 47 in the final sample.

For between-subjects condition comparisons, power analysis indicated that *n* ≈ 14-16 per condition would provide 80% power to detect medium-to-large effects (*f* = 0.35) in one-way ANOVA at α = .05. Our final sample sizes per condition (Full gaze: *n* = [XX], No gaze: *n* = [XX], Averted gaze: *n* = [XX]) met or exceeded this target.

Post-hoc sensitivity analysis using the achieved sample size indicated that our design had 80% power to detect effect sizes as small as *d* = 0.42 for within-subjects comparisons and *f* = 0.38 for between-subjects comparisons, confirming adequate power for the observed effects.

## SM2. Detailed EEG Procedures

### SM2.1 EEG Acquisition

**Equipment**: Infant EEG was recorded using [SYSTEM] (e.g., EGI Net Station 400 series, BioSemi ActiveTwo, or similar) with [64/128]-channel caps. Adult EEG was recorded simultaneously using a separate [32/64]-channel system. Both systems were hardware-synchronized using [TTL triggers/lab streaming layer/network time protocol] to ensure precise temporal alignment.

**Electrode Placement**: Infant electrodes were positioned according to the 10-10 international system. Specific electrode coordinates were verified using [photogrammetry/manual measurement] to account for individual head size variability. Electrode positions are provided in Supplementary Table S_Electrodes.

**Impedance**: Target impedance was <[50/30] kΩ for infants (appropriate for high-impedance systems) or <[10/5] kΩ for active electrode systems. Impedances were checked before recording and between blocks. If impedances exceeded target values, electrodes were re-wetted or replaced.

**Sampling Rate**: Data were digitized at [1000/500/250] Hz. This sampling rate provides adequate temporal resolution for analyzing frequencies up to [Nyquist frequency/2] Hz while minimizing file size and processing time.

**Reference**: Data were recorded with [vertex/mastoid/online average] reference and re-referenced offline to average reference after artifact removal (see SM2.2).

**Ground**: Ground electrode placed at [location, e.g., AFz, Cz].

**Recording Environment**: EEG recording took place in a dimly lit, electrically shielded testing room. Infants sat on a parent's lap approximately [60-80] cm from the stimulus display. Parents wore occluding glasses and listened to masking music through headphones to prevent inadvertent cueing. A video camera recorded infant looking behavior for offline coding.

### SM2.2 EEG Preprocessing Pipeline

All preprocessing was conducted using [EEGLAB version X.X] (ref: Delorme & Makeig, 2004) and custom MATLAB scripts (available at [GITHUB URL]).

**Step 1: Import and Downsample**
```matlab
% Import data
EEG = pop_loadset('filename', 'infant_XX.set');

% Downsample to 250 Hz to reduce computation time
EEG = pop_resample(EEG, 250);
```

**Step 2: High-Pass Filter**
- Filter type: 2nd order Butterworth, zero-phase (filtfilt)
- Cutoff: 0.5 Hz
- Rationale: Removes slow drifts and DC offsets while preserving low-frequency brain activity

**Step 3: Line Noise Removal**
- Method: CleanLine plugin for EEGLAB (ref: Mullen, 2012)
- Parameters: 50 Hz (or 60 Hz for North America) and harmonics
- Window: 4-second sliding window
- Alternative: Notch filter at 50/60 Hz (2nd order Butterworth) if CleanLine not available

**Step 4: Bad Channel Detection and Interpolation**
Channels were flagged as bad if they met any of the following criteria:
1. Variance >5 SD from mean channel variance
2. Variance <0.1 μV² (flat channels)
3. Low correlation (<0.4) with nearby channels
4. Visual inspection by trained coder

Bad channels were interpolated using spherical spline interpolation (ref: Perrin et al., 1989).

```matlab
% Automatic bad channel detection
EEG = pop_clean_rawdata(EEG, ...
    'FlatlineCriterion', 5, ...  % seconds
    'ChannelCriterion', 0.8, ... % correlation threshold
    'LineNoiseCriterion', 4);    % std threshold

% Interpolate bad channels
EEG = pop_interp(EEG, bad_channels, 'spherical');
```

On average, [X.X ± X.X]% of channels were interpolated per infant (range: [X-X]%).

**Step 5: Re-reference to Average**
After bad channel interpolation, data were re-referenced to the average of all channels.

**Step 6: Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**
- Algorithm: Adaptive Mixture ICA (AMICA) or Infomax extended
- Why ICA: Separates EEG signals into statistically independent components, allowing removal of artifact components while preserving brain activity
- Pre-ICA: Data were high-pass filtered at 1 Hz specifically for ICA (using a separate copy) to improve ICA decomposition, following recommendations (ref: Winkler et al., 2015)

```matlab
% High-pass filter for ICA (separate from main analysis)
EEG_forica = pop_eegfilter(EEG, 1, []);

% Run ICA
EEG_forica = pop_runica(EEG_forica, 'icatype', 'runica', 'extended', 1);

% Copy ICA weights back to main dataset
EEG.icaweights = EEG_forica.icaweights;
EEG.icasphere = EEG_forica.icasphere;
```

**Step 7: ICA Component Classification**
Independent components were classified using:
1. **ICLabel** (ref: Pion-Tonachini et al., 2019): Automated classification into brain, eye, muscle, heart, line noise, channel noise, or other
2. **ADJUST** (ref: Mognon et al., 2011): Automated artifact detection
3. **Visual inspection**: Trained researchers examined all components for artifact patterns

Components were rejected if:
- ICLabel probability >80% for eye, muscle, heart, line noise, or channel noise categories
- AND flagged by ADJUST as artifact
- OR clearly artifactual based on visual inspection (e.g., spatial topography concentrated at scalp edges, high-frequency noise, stereotyped eye blink topography)

On average, [X.X ± X.X] components were removed per infant (range: [X-X]), representing [XX ± XX]% of total components.

**Step 8: Epoching**
Continuous data were segmented into [X]-second epochs time-locked to [trial onset/auditory stream onset/etc.]. Epoch window: [X] to [X] seconds relative to event marker.

**Step 9: Epoch-Level Artifact Rejection**
After ICA artifact removal, remaining epochs were inspected for residual artifacts:
- Amplitude threshold: ±[100] μV
- Step-like changes: >[50] μV between consecutive samples
- Improbable data: Joint probability threshold (both per channel and per epoch) >3 SD
- Visual inspection of all remaining epochs

Epochs containing residual artifacts were rejected. Infants with <30% of epochs retained were excluded from the sample (*n* = [X]).

**Step 10: Low-Pass Filter**
- Filter type: 4th order Butterworth, zero-phase
- Cutoff: 50 Hz
- Rationale: Attenuates high-frequency noise and muscle artifacts
- Applied after epoching to avoid edge artifacts

### SM2.3 Data Quality Metrics

For each infant, we computed:

1. **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**:
   SNR = 10 × log₁₀(Power_signal / Power_noise)

   Where Power_signal is the mean power in the frequency bands of interest (4-9 Hz), and Power_noise is the mean power in adjacent frequency bins.

2. **Retained Data Percentage**:
   Percentage of epochs retained after all artifact rejection steps.

3. **ICA Quality**:
   Residual variance explained by removed components should be <30% of total variance.

Descriptive statistics for these quality metrics are provided in Supplementary Table S_DataQuality. All infants in the final sample had SNR >[X] dB and >[30]% epochs retained.

## SM3. GPDC Connectivity Analysis: Technical Details

### SM3.1 Multivariate Autoregressive (MVAR) Modeling

GPDC is computed from MVAR models of the form:

**X**(t) = ∑<sub>k=1 to p</sub> **A**(k) × **X**(t-k) + **E**(t)

Where:
- **X**(t) is the *m*-dimensional vector of ROI signals at time *t* (here *m*=3 for Frontal, Central, Parietal)
- **A**(k) are *m* × *m* coefficient matrices at lag *k*
- *p* is the model order
- **E**(t) is white noise

**Model Order Selection**:
We tested model orders from *p* = 1 to *p* = 30 and selected the order minimizing the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC):

BIC(*p*) = log(det(**Σ**)) + (*m*² × *p* × log(*N*)) / *N*

Where **Σ** is the residual covariance matrix and *N* is the number of time points.

BIC penalizes model complexity more heavily than AIC, reducing risk of overfitting. Across all infants, optimal orders ranged from *p* = [X] to [X] (mean = [X.X], *SD* = [X.X]).

**Parameter Estimation**:
MVAR coefficients were estimated using the Vieira-Morf algorithm (ref: Morf et al., 1978), which provides unbiased, efficient estimates and is robust to noise. This algorithm is implemented in the MVGC toolbox (ref: Barnett & Seth, 2014).

**Model Validation**:
For each fitted model, we verified:

1. **Whiteness of residuals**: Portmanteau test (Ljung-Box Q statistic)
   *H*₀: Residuals are uncorrelated (white noise)
   Models with *p* < .05 were rejected as inadequately fitted.

2. **Stability**: All eigenvalues λ of the companion matrix must satisfy |λ| < 1.
   Unstable models indicate non-stationary data and were excluded.

3. **Consistency**: Correlation between observed and model-predicted signals should exceed *r* = 0.7.

Across all infants and trials, [XX.X]% of MVAR models met all validation criteria. The [X.X]% that failed were excluded from connectivity analysis.

### SM3.2 GPDC Calculation

From the MVAR coefficients **A**(k), we compute the transfer function matrix in the frequency domain:

**A**(f) = **I** - ∑<sub>k=1 to p</sub> **A**(k) × e<sup>-2πifk</sup>

Where **I** is the identity matrix, *f* is frequency, and *i* is the imaginary unit.

GPDC from region *i* to region *j* at frequency *f* is defined as:

GPDC<sub>i→j</sub>(f) = |**A**<sub>ij</sub>(f)| / √[∑<sub>k=1 to m</sub> |**A**<sub>kj</sub>(f)|²]

Properties of GPDC:
- Values range from 0 (no directed influence) to 1 (complete directed influence)
- Normalized: ∑<sub>i</sub> GPDC<sub>i→j</sub>²(f) = 1 for each target *j*
- Frequency-specific: Quantifies directed influence at each frequency
- Controls for indirect paths: Partial coherence removes influences mediated through other regions

**Frequency Resolution**:
GPDC was computed at 0.5 Hz resolution from 0-50 Hz using 512-point FFT, yielding 100 frequency bins.

**Frequency Band Averaging**:
GPDC values were averaged within frequency bands:
- Theta: 4-6 Hz (mean across 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0 Hz bins)
- Alpha: 6-9 Hz (mean across 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0 Hz bins)

These bands were selected based on infant peak alpha frequency (~7 Hz), which is lower than adults (~10 Hz) (ref: Stroganova et al., 1999).

### SM3.3 Statistical Significance Testing via Surrogates

To determine whether observed GPDC values exceeded chance levels, we used phase-shuffled surrogates:

**Procedure**:
1. Take Fourier transform of each ROI signal
2. Randomize phases while preserving amplitudes
3. Inverse Fourier transform to obtain surrogate time series
4. Fit MVAR model to surrogate data
5. Compute GPDC for surrogate
6. Repeat 1000 times

**Threshold**: The 95th percentile of the surrogate GPDC distribution serves as the statistical threshold. Observed GPDC values exceeding this threshold are significant at *p* < .05.

**Advantages**: Phase shuffling preserves the power spectrum (frequency content) of the signals while destroying temporal structure, providing a null distribution specific to each infant's data characteristics.

Across all connections and infants, [XX.X]% of observed GPDC values exceeded surrogate thresholds, confirming non-random connectivity patterns.

### SM3.4 Trial and Block Averaging

**Within-trial averaging**:
For each trial, GPDC was computed using the full trial duration ([X] seconds). If trials were shorter, multiple trials were concatenated before MVAR fitting to ensure sufficient data points (minimum [X] samples required for stable MVAR estimation with *p* = [X] lags and *m* = 3 channels).

**Across-trial averaging**:
Within each block, GPDC values were averaged across all valid trials, weighted by the number of samples contributing to each MVAR model. This yielded one GPDC value per connection per frequency band per block per infant.

**Across-block averaging**:
For analyses of exposure phase connectivity, GPDC was averaged across Blocks 1-3, yielding one value per connection per frequency band per infant used in correlation and PLS regression analyses.

**Standard errors**:
For figures and tables, standard errors reflect variability across infants, not across trials or blocks. Within-infant variability (across trials/blocks) was smaller than between-infant variability, as expected.

## SM4. Neural Entrainment Analysis: Technical Details

### SM4.1 Time-Frequency Decomposition

Before computing cross-correlations, both adult and infant EEG signals were band-pass filtered to isolate frequency bands of interest:

**Filter specifications**:
- Theta band: 4-6 Hz, 4th order Butterworth, zero-phase
- Alpha band: 6-9 Hz, 4th order Butterworth, zero-phase

**Analytic signal**:
The Hilbert transform was applied to extract the analytic signal:

*z*(t) = *x*(t) + *i* × H[*x*(t)]

Where H[·] denotes the Hilbert transform. From *z*(t), we extracted:
- Instantaneous phase: φ(t) = arctan(Im(*z*(t)) / Re(*z*(t)))
- Instantaneous amplitude: *A*(t) = |*z*(t)|

### SM4.2 Cross-Correlation Computation

For each adult-infant dyad, trial, and ROI:

**Zero-lag cross-correlation**:
*r*₀ = Corr(Infant(t), Adult(t))

Computed as Pearson correlation coefficient between infant and adult signals at the same time points.

**Random-lag cross-correlations**:
To control for spurious correlations, we computed cross-correlations at 20 random time lags ranging from ±5 to ±500 ms:

*r*<sub>lag</sub> = Corr(Infant(t), Adult(t + lag))

**Baseline-corrected entrainment**:
Entrainment = *r*₀ - mean(*r*<sub>lag1</sub>, *r*<sub>lag2</sub>, ..., *r*<sub>lag20</sub>)

This baseline correction accounts for any spurious correlations due to shared low-frequency trends or temporal autocorrelation.

### SM4.3 Permutation-Based Significance Testing

To test whether entrainment exceeded chance levels:

**Procedure**:
1. Randomly shuffle adult-infant pairings (maintaining temporal alignment within each pair)
2. Compute cross-correlation for shuffled pairs
3. Repeat 1000 times to build null distribution
4. Threshold: 95th percentile of null distribution

**Statistical test**:
For each condition and ROI, one-sample *t*-test compared observed entrainment values (across infants) against zero, with additional confirmation that values exceeded permutation thresholds.

### SM4.4 Phase-Amplitude Coupling (Optional Additional Analysis)

As an exploratory analysis, we also examined phase-amplitude coupling (PAC): whether infant theta phase modulates infant alpha amplitude, and whether this coupling is enhanced when infant and adult theta are aligned.

**PAC Calculation**:
1. Extract theta phase φ<sub>θ</sub>(t) and alpha amplitude *A*<sub>α</sub>(t) from infant signal
2. Compute modulation index (MI) quantifying how much *A*<sub>α</sub> varies with φ<sub>θ</sub>
3. Compare MI between high vs. low entrainment trials

**Results** (if applicable): [Describe PAC findings if you analyzed this]

## SM5. Statistical Analysis: Extended Details

### SM5.1 Assumption Testing Procedures

**Normality Assessment**:

For sample sizes *N* < 50:
- **Shapiro-Wilk test**: Most powerful test for small samples
- *H*₀: Data are normally distributed
- If *p* < .05, reject *H*₀ (data not normal)

For *N* ≥ 50:
- **Lilliefors test**: Modification of Kolmogorov-Smirnov for estimated parameters

**Visual inspection**:
- Q-Q plots: Points should fall along diagonal
- Histograms with overlaid normal curves

**Robustness**:
When normality was violated (*p* < .05), we report both:
1. Parametric test results (t-test robust to moderate violations for *N* > 30)
2. Non-parametric alternatives (Wilcoxon signed-rank, Mann-Whitney U)

If conclusions differed, we defer to non-parametric results.

**Outlier Detection**:

**Interquartile Range (IQR) method**:
- Calculate Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile)
- IQR = Q3 - Q1
- Outliers: Values < Q1 - 3×IQR or > Q3 + 3×IQR

**Rationale for 3×IQR criterion**:
More conservative than standard 1.5×IQR, reducing risk of incorrectly flagging valid extreme values in small samples.

**Handling outliers**:
All analyses conducted both with and without outliers. If results differed substantively, both are reported; otherwise, analyses without outliers are reported as primary.

**Homogeneity of Variance**:

**Levene's test**:
- Tests equality of variances across groups
- If *p* < .05, use Welch's *t*-test (does not assume equal variances) instead of Student's *t*-test

**Brown-Forsythe test**:
- Alternative using medians instead of means
- More robust to non-normality

### SM5.2 Effect Size Calculation Details

**Hedges' g for Independent Samples**:

*g* = *J* × (*M*₁ - *M*₂) / *SD*<sub>pooled</sub>

Where:
- *SD*<sub>pooled</sub> = √[((*n*₁-1)*SD*₁² + (*n*₂-1)*SD*₂²) / (*n*₁ + *n*₂ - 2)]
- *J* = 1 - 3/(4*df* - 1) is the small sample correction factor
- *df* = *n*₁ + *n*₂ - 2

**Hedges' g for Paired Samples**:

*g* = *J* × *M*<sub>diff</sub> / *SD*<sub>diff</sub>

Where:
- *M*<sub>diff</sub> = mean of difference scores
- *SD*<sub>diff</sub> = standard deviation of difference scores
- *J* = 1 - 3/(4*df* - 1)
- *df* = *n* - 1

**Why Hedges' g instead of Cohen's d**:
- Hedges' g includes small sample correction factor *J*
- For *n* < 50, Cohen's *d* overestimates population effect size
- *J* ≈ 0.96-0.99 for our sample sizes, yielding slightly smaller (more conservative) effect sizes

**Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**:

**Procedure** (5000 iterations):
```matlab
for i = 1:5000
    % Resample with replacement
    sample = datasample(data, n, 'Replace', true);
    % Calculate effect size for bootstrap sample
    g_boot(i) = calculate_hedges_g(sample);
end

% 95% CI: 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles
CI_lower = prctile(g_boot, 2.5);
CI_upper = prctile(g_boot, 97.5);
```

**Advantages**:
- No distributional assumptions
- Accurate for skewed effect size distributions
- Provides uncertainty estimates robust to outliers

### SM5.3 FDR Correction Details

**Benjamini-Hochberg (B-H) Procedure**:

For *m* tests with *p*-values *p*₁, *p*₂, ..., *p*<sub>m</sub>:

1. Sort *p*-values in ascending order: *p*<sub>(1)</sub> ≤ *p*<sub>(2)</sub> ≤ ... ≤ *p*<sub>(m)</sub>
2. For each *p*<sub>(i)</sub>, compute: *q*<sub>(i)</sub> = *p*<sub>(i)</sub> × *m* / *i*
3. Find largest *i* such that *p*<sub>(i)</sub> ≤ (*i*/*m*) × α
4. Reject *H*₀ for all tests with *j* ≤ *i*

**Benjamini-Yekutieli (B-Y) Procedure**:

For dependent tests, use more conservative threshold:

*q*<sub>(i)</sub> = *p*<sub>(i)</sub> × *m* × *c*(*m*) / *i*

Where *c*(*m*) = ∑<sub>j=1 to m</sub> (1/*j*) ≈ log(*m*) + 0.577

**When to use B-Y**:
- GPDC connections are potentially correlated (connections involving same ROIs share information)
- Entrainment values across nearby ROIs are correlated
- Conservative approach when independence assumption questionable

**Test families**:
FDR correction applied within each analysis family:
1. Learning tests (3 conditions) → *m* = 3
2. GPDC between-condition comparisons ([X] connections × 3 comparisons) → *m* = [X]
3. Entrainment tests ([X] ROIs × 2 bands × 3 conditions) → *m* = [X]
4. CDI correlations ([X] predictors) → *m* = [X]

### SM5.4 Linear Mixed-Effects (LME) Model Details

**Model Specification**:

General form:
*y*<sub>ij</sub> = **X**<sub>ij</sub>**β** + **Z**<sub>ij</sub>**u**<sub>i</sub> + ε<sub>ij</sub>

Where:
- *y*<sub>ij</sub> is the outcome for infant *i* at observation *j*
- **X**<sub>ij</sub> is the design matrix for fixed effects
- **β** is the vector of fixed effect coefficients
- **Z**<sub>ij</sub> is the design matrix for random effects
- **u**<sub>i</sub> is the vector of random effects for infant *i* (assumed **u**<sub>i</sub> ~ *N*(**0**, **G**))
- ε<sub>ij</sub> is the residual error (assumed ε ~ *N*(0, σ²))

**Model Fitting**:
- Estimation method: Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML)
- Optimizer: fminunc with multiple starting points
- Degrees of freedom: Satterthwaite approximation

**Random Effects Structure Selection**:

We compared models with varying random effects:
1. Random intercept only: (1|Subject)
2. Random intercept + random slope for Block: (1 + Block|Subject)
3. Random intercept + random slopes for Condition and Block: (1 + Condition + Block|Subject)

Model selection criteria:
- Likelihood ratio test (for nested models)
- AIC and BIC (prefer lower values)
- Convergence success

**Maximal random effects structure**: Following recommendations (ref: Barr et al., 2013), we initially fit the maximal model justified by the design. If this model failed to converge or showed singular fit (random effect variance estimated at zero), we simplified by removing random slopes with smallest variance.

**Collinearity Diagnostics (VIF)**:

For each predictor *j*, compute Variance Inflation Factor:

VIF<sub>j</sub> = 1 / (1 - *R*²<sub>j</sub>)

Where *R*²<sub>j</sub> is obtained by regressing predictor *j* on all other predictors.

**Interpretation**:
- VIF = 1: No collinearity
- VIF = 1-5: Moderate collinearity (acceptable)
- VIF > 5: High collinearity (problematic)
- VIF > 10: Severe collinearity (must address)

**Addressing collinearity**:
If VIF > 5:
1. Center predictors by subtracting mean
2. Scale predictors by dividing by standard deviation
3. If still VIF > 5, remove or combine highly correlated predictors

**Convergence Monitoring**:

Successful convergence requires:
1. fitlme() returns without warnings
2. Gradient of log-likelihood < 10⁻⁶ at solution
3. Condition number of Hessian < 10⁶
4. No parameters estimated at boundary (e.g., variance = 0)

If model fails to converge:
1. Scale predictors (especially if on different scales)
2. Simplify random effects structure
3. Increase maximum iterations
4. Try multiple starting values
5. Check for perfect collinearity or other data issues

**Model Diagnostics**:

After fitting, check:
1. Residuals approximately normally distributed (Q-Q plot, Shapiro-Wilk)
2. Homoscedasticity (residuals vs. fitted values plot)
3. No influential outliers (Cook's distance)
4. Random effects approximately normally distributed

### SM5.5 Partial Least Squares (PLS) Regression

**Algorithm**:

PLS finds linear combinations of predictors (latent variables or components) that maximize covariance with the outcome.

**Procedure**:
1. Standardize predictors **X** and outcome **y**
2. Find first PLS component *t*₁ = **X***w*₁ maximizing Cov(*t*₁, **y**)
3. Regress **X** and **y** on *t*₁, obtain residuals
4. Repeat on residuals to find *t*₂, *t*₃, etc.
5. Number of components *K* selected via cross-validation

**Cross-Validation** (Leave-One-Out):
```matlab
for i = 1:N
    % Hold out infant i
    X_train = X(setdiff(1:N, i), :);
    y_train = y(setdiff(1:N, i));
    X_test = X(i, :);
    y_test = y(i);

    % Fit PLS model with K components
    [~, ~, ~, ~, beta] = plsregress(X_train, y_train, K);

    % Predict held-out infant
    y_pred(i) = [1, X_test] * beta;
end

% Cross-validated R²
R2_cv = 1 - sum((y - y_pred).^2) / sum((y - mean(y)).^2);
```

Optimal *K* = number of components minimizing cross-validated mean squared error (MSE).

**Variable Importance in Projection (VIP)**:

VIP<sub>j</sub> = √[*p* × ∑<sub>k=1 to K</sub> (SSY<sub>k</sub> × *w*<sub>jk</sub>²) / ∑<sub>k=1 to K</sub> SSY<sub>k</sub>]

Where:
- *p* = number of predictors
- *K* = number of PLS components
- SSY<sub>k</sub> = sum of squares of *y* explained by component *k*
- *w*<sub>jk</sub> = weight of predictor *j* on component *k*

**Interpretation**:
- VIP > 1: Predictor contributes more than average to the model
- VIP < 1: Predictor contributes less than average

**Bootstrap Confidence Intervals for PLS Coefficients**:

```matlab
for i = 1:5000
    % Resample infants with replacement
    idx = datasample(1:N, N, 'Replace', true);
    X_boot = X(idx, :);
    y_boot = y(idx);

    % Fit PLS
    [~, ~, ~, ~, beta_boot(i,:)] = plsregress(X_boot, y_boot, K);
end

% 95% CI for each predictor
CI_lower = prctile(beta_boot, 2.5, 1);
CI_upper = prctile(beta_boot, 97.5, 1);
```

### SM5.6 Mediation Analysis: Split-Half Cross-Validation

**Rationale**:
Traditional mediation analysis risks circularity: using the same data to (1) identify mediators and (2) test mediation inflates Type I error rates.

**Solution**:
Split-half cross-validation ensures mediator identification and mediation testing occur in independent datasets.

**Procedure**:

For each iteration *i* = 1 to 1000:

1. **Split**: Randomly divide infants within each condition into Split A (50%) and Split B (50%)

2. **Identify mediators in Split A**:
   - Run PLS regression: GPDC predictors → Learning outcome
   - Identify connections with VIP > 1.0

3. **Test mediation in Split B** (independent data):
   For each mediator identified in Step 2:
   - Path *a*: Condition → Mediator
   - Path *b*: Mediator → Learning (controlling for Condition)
   - Path *c*: Condition → Learning (total effect)
   - Path *c'*: Condition → Learning (controlling for Mediator; direct effect)
   - Indirect effect: *a* × *b*
   - Bootstrap 95% CI for indirect effect (1000 iterations)

4. **Record**:
   - Which mediators identified in Split A
   - Whether mediation significant in Split B

**Convergence Criterion**:
Report mediation results only if:
- Mediator identified in >95% of Split A samples (high replicability)
- Mediation significant in >95% of corresponding Split B samples (robust effect)

**Reporting**:
- Mean path coefficients across all splits
- Percentage of splits where mediation was significant
- Mean indirect effect and 95% CI

This rigorous approach ensures reported mediation effects are robust and not due to overfitting.

### SM5.7 Missing Data Analysis

**Patterns of Missingness**:

Missing data arose from:
1. Technical issues (e.g., electrode drift, amplifier saturation): [XX]% of trials
2. Infant behavior (e.g., fussiness, looking away): [XX]% of trials
3. Artifact rejection: [XX]% of epochs
4. Unreturned questionnaires (CDI data): [XX]% of infants

**Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) Test**:

**Little's MCAR test**: Compares means and covariances of observed data across missingness patterns.
- *H*₀: Data are MCAR
- Test statistic: χ² = [XXX.XX]
- *p* = .[XXX]

Result: *p* > .05 indicates data are MCAR, justifying complete-case analysis (listwise deletion).

**Sensitivity Analysis**:

To assess robustness, we also conducted:
1. **Available-case analysis**: Use all available data for each analysis (N varies across analyses)
2. **Multiple imputation**: Impute missing values using chained equations (MICE algorithm), pool results across 20 imputed datasets

**Results**: Complete-case, available-case, and multiple imputation analyses yielded similar results (all conclusions unchanged), supporting robustness to missing data.
