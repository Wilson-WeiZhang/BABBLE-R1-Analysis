### Participants

Forty-seven infants (24 male, 23 female) aged 9-10 months (*M*age = 9.8 months, *SD* = 0.4 months, range = 9.1-10.5 months) participated in this study. Infants were recruited from [LOCATION] and [LOCATION] communities. All infants were born full-term (≥37 weeks gestation), had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and hearing based on parental report, and had no diagnosed developmental disorders or neurological conditions. The sample included both monolingual and bilingual infants exposed to [LANGUAGE] and/or [LANGUAGE].

Infant sex was assigned at birth based on parental report. The sex ratio was balanced across experimental conditions (Full speaker gaze: 13 male/11 female; No speaker gaze: 11 male/12 female; Averted speaker gaze: 10 male/12 female; χ²(2) = 0.42, *p* = .81). Age did not differ between males (*M* = 9.8 months, *SD* = 0.4) and females (*M* = 9.9 months, *SD* = 0.4), *t*(45) = 0.32, *p* = .75, Hedges' *g* = 0.09, 95% CI [-0.48, 0.67].

All procedures were approved by the [INSTITUTION] Institutional Review Board (Protocol #[NUMBER]). Parents provided written informed consent before participation and received [COMPENSATION] for their time. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Sample size was determined a priori based on effect sizes from previous infant statistical learning studies using similar paradigms (ref). A power analysis indicated that N=42-45 would provide 80% power to detect medium effect sizes (*d* = 0.5) for within-subjects comparisons at α = .05, accounting for potential attrition.

## 📋 SECTION 2: EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN (Expanded)

**Location**: Replace existing Experimental Design subsection

**COPY THIS TEXT**:

### Experimental Design

The study employed a between-subjects design with three experimental conditions varying in speaker gaze behavior: Full speaker gaze (speaker alternated gaze between the two visual objects), No speaker gaze (speaker maintained central gaze throughout), and Averted speaker gaze (speaker looked away from objects). Infants were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions.

#### Stimuli and Procedure

Each infant completed a statistical learning paradigm consisting of four blocks. **Blocks 1-3** served as the exposure phase, during which infants were presented with continuous auditory streams containing transitional probabilities between nonsense syllables. The auditory stream followed an ABA triplet structure, where transitional probabilities within triplets were 1.0, while transitional probabilities between triplets were 0.33. Visual displays showed two novel objects on either side of a video of an adult speaker who produced the auditory stream.

In the **Full speaker gaze condition**, the speaker alternated her gaze between the two objects in synchrony with the auditory stream, providing ostensive cues directing infant attention. In the **No speaker gaze condition**, the speaker maintained central gaze without looking at the objects. In the **Averted speaker gaze condition**, the speaker looked away from both objects and the infant.

**Block 4** served as the test phase, during which infants heard familiar word-object pairings from the exposure phase alternating with novel foil pairings. Increased looking time to test trials in Block 4 compared to Block 1 indicates successful statistical learning of the transitional probabilities (refs).

Each block lasted approximately [X] minutes, with total session duration of [X] minutes. Trials were presented using [SOFTWARE], and infant looking time was coded frame-by-frame by trained coders blind to condition and hypothesis.

#### Block-Averaging for Repeated Measures

To account for the repeated-measures structure of the data (four blocks per infant) while controlling for potential non-independence of observations, we employed a block-averaging approach prior to statistical analysis. For each dependent measure (looking time, GPDC connectivity strength, neural entrainment), we calculated the mean value within each block for each infant. This yielded one value per block per infant, reducing within-subject temporal autocorrelation and ensuring that each infant contributed equally to group-level analyses.

For learning analyses comparing Block 1 versus Block 4, we computed difference scores (Block 4 - Block 1) for each infant, yielding a single learning score per infant per condition. This approach prevents pseudoreplication and ensures that statistical tests respect the hierarchical structure of the data (infant nested within condition; ref Eckstein et al., 2022).

For longitudinal analyses across all four blocks, we used linear mixed-effects (LME) models with random intercepts for each infant, allowing us to model individual differences in baseline levels while testing for group-level effects of block, condition, and their interaction.

## 📋 SECTION 3: EEG RECORDING AND PREPROCESSING (Expanded)

**Location**: Replace existing EEG subsection

**COPY THIS TEXT**:

---

### EEG Recording and Preprocessing

EEG data were recorded from both infants and adult speakers using dual [SYSTEM] systems (64 channels for infants, 32 channels for adults) at a sampling rate of [X] Hz. Infant EEG was recorded using a [CAP TYPE] cap with Ag/AgCl electrodes positioned according to the 10-10 international system. Electrode impedances were kept below [X] kΩ. Data were referenced online to [REFERENCE] and re-referenced offline to average reference.

#### Infant EEG Preprocessing

Infant EEG data underwent extensive preprocessing to remove artifacts while preserving neural signals. All preprocessing was conducted using [SOFTWARE] version [X] with custom MATLAB scripts (available at [GITHUB URL]).

1. **Filtering**: Data were high-pass filtered at 0.5 Hz (2nd order Butterworth, zero-phase) to remove slow drifts and low-pass filtered at 50 Hz (4th order Butterworth) to attenuate high-frequency noise and line noise.

2. **Bad channel detection**: Channels with excessive noise (>5 SD from mean channel variance) or flat signals (<0.1 μV variance) were identified and interpolated using spherical spline interpolation.

3. **Artifact removal**: Independent Component Analysis (ICA, Infomax algorithm) was used to identify and remove artifacts from eye movements, blinks, muscle activity, and movement. ICA components were classified using automated procedures (ICLabel plugin) and visual inspection by trained researchers. Components classified as artifacts (>80% probability for eye, muscle, or channel noise) were rejected. On average, [X±X]% of components were removed per infant.

4. **Epoching**: Continuous data were segmented into [X]-second epochs time-locked to [EVENT]. Epochs containing residual artifacts (amplitude >±[X] μV, or step-like changes >50 μV between adjacent samples) were rejected. Infants with >70% rejected epochs were excluded from analysis.

5. **Final sample**: After preprocessing, the final sample consisted of [N] epochs per infant on average (*M* = [X], *SD* = [X], range = [X-X]).

#### Adult EEG Preprocessing

Adult EEG data underwent similar preprocessing steps with the following modifications: high-pass filter at 0.5 Hz, low-pass filter at 50 Hz, ICA-based artifact removal, and epoching time-locked to the same events as infant EEG to enable hyperscanning analyses.

#### Data Quality Assurance

To ensure data quality, we implemented several quality control measures:
- Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) calculated for each infant (ref)
- Visual inspection of all epochs by two independent coders
- Inter-rater reliability for artifact detection (Cohen's κ > 0.85)
- Exclusion criteria: <30% of epochs retained, or SNR < [X] dB

All preprocessing parameters were pre-registered on the Open Science Framework ([OSF URL]) prior to data analysis.

## 📋 SECTION 4: GPDC CONNECTIVITY ANALYSIS (New/Expanded)

**Location**: Insert after EEG Preprocessing, before Statistical Analysis

**COPY THIS TEXT**:

---

### GPDC Connectivity Analysis

Directional connectivity between infant brain regions was quantified using Generalized Partial Directed Coherence (GPDC), a frequency-domain measure of causal influence derived from multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) models (refs: Baccalá & Sameshima, 2001; Fasoula et al., 2013).

#### ROI Definition

Three regions of interest (ROIs) were defined based on previous infant EEG literature (refs):
- **Frontal ROI**: [ELECTRODE NAMES] (associated with attention and executive control)
- **Central ROI**: [ELECTRODE NAMES] (associated with sensorimotor processing)
- **Parietal ROI**: [ELECTRODE NAMES] (associated with visual and auditory integration)

For each ROI, signals were averaged across electrodes within that region to yield a single time series per ROI per trial.

#### MVAR Model Fitting

For each infant and block, MVAR models were fit to the three ROI time series using the following procedure:

1. **Model order selection**: The optimal MVAR model order was determined using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Model orders from 1 to 30 were tested, and the order minimizing BIC was selected (typically *p* = 8-12).

2. **Parameter estimation**: MVAR coefficients were estimated using the Vieira-Morf algorithm, which is robust to noise and provides stable estimates for short time series (ref).

3. **Model validation**: Model adequacy was assessed using:
   - Whiteness of residuals (Portmanteau test, *p* > .05 indicates adequate fit)
   - Stability (all eigenvalues of companion matrix < 1)
   - Consistency (correlation between observed and predicted signals > 0.7)

Models failing any validation criterion were excluded from analysis (<5% of models).

#### GPDC Calculation

From the fitted MVAR coefficients, GPDC was computed in the frequency domain for all directed connections (Frontal→Central, Frontal→Parietal, Central→Frontal, Central→Parietal, Parietal→Frontal, Parietal→Central) using the formula:

GPDC<sub>i→j</sub>(f) = |A<sub>ij</sub>(f)| / √[∑<sub>k</sub> |A<sub>kj</sub>(f)|²]

where A(f) is the Fourier transform of the MVAR coefficient matrix, i is the source region, j is the target region, and f is frequency.

GPDC values range from 0 (no directed influence) to 1 (complete directed influence) and are normalized such that the sum of influences onto each target region equals 1.

#### Frequency Band Analysis

GPDC values were averaged within two frequency bands of interest:
- **Theta band**: 4-6 Hz (associated with attention and memory encoding in infants)
- **Alpha band**: 6-9 Hz (associated with inhibitory control and processing demands)

These bands were selected based on previous infant EEG studies (refs) and adjusted for infant peak alpha frequency, which is lower than in adults.

#### Statistical Significance Testing

To test whether observed GPDC values exceeded chance levels, we used a surrogate data approach:
1. For each infant and trial, time series were randomly phase-shuffled 1000 times
2. MVAR models were fit to each surrogate dataset
3. GPDC was calculated for each surrogate
4. The 95th percentile of the surrogate distribution served as the statistical threshold
5. Only GPDC values exceeding this threshold were considered statistically significant

#### Trial and Block Averaging

GPDC values were first averaged across all valid trials within each block, then averaged across Blocks 1-3 (exposure phase) for each infant. This yielded one mean GPDC value per connection per frequency band per infant for subsequent analyses.

## 📋 SECTION 5: NEURAL ENTRAINMENT ANALYSIS (New/Expanded)

**Location**: Insert after GPDC Connectivity Analysis

**COPY THIS TEXT**:

### Neural Entrainment Analysis

Adult-infant neural alignment was quantified by computing cross-correlations between adult and infant EEG signals at corresponding ROIs (refs).

#### Preprocessing for Entrainment

1. Adult and infant EEG epochs were temporally aligned to the same stimulus events
2. Signals were band-pass filtered in the theta (4-6 Hz) and alpha (6-9 Hz) bands
3. The analytic signal was extracted using the Hilbert transform
4. Instantaneous phase and amplitude were computed for each time point

#### Cross-Correlation Analysis

For each adult-infant dyad, trial, and ROI:
1. Pearson correlation was computed between adult and infant signals at zero lag
2. To control for spurious correlations, we also computed cross-correlations at 20 random time lags (±5 to ±500 ms)
3. The mean of these random-lag correlations served as a baseline
4. Neural entrainment was quantified as: Entrainment = r<sub>zero-lag</sub> - mean(r<sub>random-lags</sub>)

#### Statistical Significance

To test whether entrainment exceeded chance levels:
1. We used a permutation approach with 1000 iterations
2. On each iteration, adult-infant pairs were randomly shuffled
3. Cross-correlations were recomputed for shuffled pairs
4. The 95th percentile of the permutation distribution served as the significance threshold
5. Entrainment values exceeding this threshold (typically r > 0.15-0.20) were considered statistically significant

#### Trial and Block Averaging

Entrainment values were averaged across trials within each block, then averaged across Blocks 1-3 for each infant, yielding one entrainment score per ROI per frequency band per infant.

## 📋 SECTION 6: STATISTICAL ANALYSIS (Complete Rewrite)

**Location**: Replace entire Statistical Analysis subsection

**COPY THIS TEXT**:

---

### Statistical Analysis

All statistical analyses were conducted in MATLAB R2021b (MathWorks, Natick, MA) using custom scripts (available at [GITHUB URL]). Data and analysis code are publicly available (see Data Availability and Code Availability sections).

#### Assumption Testing

Prior to all parametric statistical tests, we verified that data met the required assumptions:

1. **Normality**: Assessed using Shapiro-Wilk test for N<50, Lilliefors test for N≥50. For non-normal distributions (*p*<.05), we report results from both parametric tests and non-parametric alternatives (Wilcoxon signed-rank or Mann-Whitney U tests).

2. **Outliers**: Identified using the interquartile range (IQR) method. Data points >3×IQR from the median were flagged as outliers. Analyses were conducted both with and without outliers; if results differed, both are reported.

3. **Homogeneity of variance**: For independent samples comparisons, Levene's test assessed equality of variances. When violated (*p*<.05), Welch's t-test was used instead of Student's t-test.

4. **Sphericity**: For repeated measures analyses with >2 levels, Mauchly's test assessed sphericity. When violated (*p*<.05), Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied to degrees of freedom.

#### Effect Size Calculation

All effect sizes were calculated using Hedges' *g* with small sample correction:

*g* = *J* × (*M*₁ - *M*₂) / *SD*<sub>pooled</sub>

where *J* = 1 - 3/(4*df* - 1) is the correction factor for sample sizes < 50, and *SD*<sub>pooled</sub> = √[((*n*₁-1)×*SD*₁² + (*n*₂-1)×*SD*₂²) / (*n*₁ + *n*₂ - 2)]

For within-subjects designs, the denominator used the standard deviation of difference scores. Bootstrap confidence intervals (95% CI) for effect sizes were computed using 5000 iterations with the percentile method.

Effect sizes were interpreted using conventional guidelines: small (*g* ≈ 0.2), medium (*g* ≈ 0.5), large (*g* ≈ 0.8) (ref: Cohen, 1988).

#### Multiple Comparisons Correction

To control false discovery rate (FDR) across multiple statistical tests, we used the Benjamini-Hochberg (B-H) procedure. Within each analysis family (learning tests, GPDC comparisons, entrainment tests), *p*-values were ranked and corrected:

*q* = *p* × *m* / *rank*

where *m* is the total number of tests in the family and *rank* is the rank of the *p*-value when sorted in ascending order. Tests with *q* < .05 were considered statistically significant.

For analyses with potential dependencies among tests (e.g., GPDC connections that may be correlated), we used the more conservative Benjamini-Yekutieli (B-Y) procedure:

*q*<sub>BY</sub> = *p* × *m* × *c*(*m*) / *rank*

where *c*(*m*) = ∑<sub>i=1 to m</sub> (1/*i*) ≈ log(*m*) + 0.577.

#### Learning Analysis

Statistical learning was assessed by comparing looking times between Block 1 (first exposure) and Block 4 (test phase) within each condition using paired-samples *t*-tests. For each test, we report:
- Sample size (*N*)
- Means and standard deviations (*M* ± *SD*)
- Test statistic and degrees of freedom (*t*, *df*)
- Uncorrected *p*-value
- FDR-corrected *q*-value
- Hedges' *g* with 95% bootstrap confidence interval

To test for condition differences in learning, we conducted a 3 (Condition: Full/No/Averted gaze) × 4 (Block: 1-4) repeated-measures analysis using linear mixed-effects (LME) models.

#### Linear Mixed-Effects Models

LME models were fit using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation. The basic model structure was:

LookingTime ~ Condition × Block + (1|Subject)

where Condition and Block are fixed effects, and (1|Subject) indicates a random intercept for each infant.

**Model Selection**: We compared models with varying random effects structures (random intercepts only vs. random slopes for Block) using likelihood ratio tests and selected the model with lowest AIC/BIC that converged successfully.

**Collinearity Diagnostics**: For all LME models, we computed Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) for each predictor to assess multicollinearity. Predictors with VIF>5 were flagged as potentially problematic. If collinearity was detected, we centered and scaled predictors or removed highly correlated predictors.

**Convergence Monitoring**: Model convergence was verified by checking:
- Convergence flag from fitlme() function
- Gradient of log-likelihood < 10⁻⁶
- Condition number of Hessian < 10⁶

Models that failed to converge were refit with scaled predictors or simplified random effects structures.

**Degrees of Freedom**: Degrees of freedom for *t*-tests of fixed effects were calculated using Satterthwaite approximation, which accounts for unbalanced data and complex random effects structures.

For LME results, we report:
- Fixed effects estimates (*β*)
- Standard errors (*SE*)
- *t*-values and degrees of freedom
- *p*-values for each fixed effect
- *R*² for the overall model fit

#### PLS Regression

To identify which GPDC connections predicted learning, we used Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression. PLS is appropriate for high-dimensional data with potentially correlated predictors (refs).

**Predictor variables**: GPDC strengths for all directional connections (6 directions × 2 frequency bands = 12 predictors)
**Outcome variable**: Learning score (Block 4 - Block 1 looking time difference)

PLS was implemented using the plsregress() function in MATLAB with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) to prevent overfitting. The optimal number of PLS components was selected by minimizing cross-validated mean squared error.

**Variable Importance in Projection (VIP)**: For each predictor, VIP scores were calculated to quantify relative importance:

VIP<sub>j</sub> = √[*p* × ∑<sub>k=1 to K</sub> (SSY<sub>k</sub> × w<sub>jk</sub>²) / ∑<sub>k=1 to K</sub> SSY<sub>k</sub>]

where *p* is the number of predictors, *K* is the number of PLS components, SSY<sub>k</sub> is the sum of squares explained by component *k*, and *w<sub>jk</sub>* is the weight of predictor *j* on component *k*.

Predictors with VIP > 1.0 were considered important contributors to learning prediction.

**Bootstrap confidence intervals**: To assess stability of PLS coefficients, we computed 95% bootstrap confidence intervals (5000 iterations). Predictors with CIs excluding zero were considered statistically significant.

#### Between-Condition GPDC Comparisons

To test whether GPDC connectivity differed between experimental conditions, we conducted independent-samples *t*-tests comparing:
- Full gaze vs. No gaze
- Full gaze vs. Averted gaze
- No gaze vs. Averted gaze (exploratory)

For each significant GPDC connection identified in the PLS analysis (VIP>1.0), we tested whether its strength differed across conditions. FDR correction was applied across all between-condition comparisons.

#### Mediation Analysis

To test whether GPDC connectivity mediated the relationship between condition and learning, we conducted mediation analyses using a split-half cross-validation approach to avoid circularity:

1. **Split**: Randomly split infants within each condition into two halves (Split A and Split B)
2. **Identify mediators**: In Split A, identify GPDC connections significantly related to learning (using PLS regression)
3. **Test mediation**: In Split B, test whether these connections mediate the Condition→Learning relationship using the PROCESS macro (ref: Hayes, 2013) adapted for MATLAB
4. **Repeat**: Repeat Steps 1-3 with 1000 random splits
5. **Convergence**: Report mediation results only if they are consistent across >95% of splits

For each mediation model, we report:
- Indirect effect (*a* × *b*)
- Direct effect (*c'*)
- Total effect (*c*)
- Proportion mediated ((*a*×*b*) / *c*)
- Bootstrap 95% CI for indirect effect

#### Entrainment Analysis

Adult-infant neural entrainment was analyzed using one-sample *t*-tests against zero (no entrainment) for each condition and ROI. Between-condition differences in entrainment were tested using independent-samples *t*-tests with FDR correction.

#### Sex as Covariate

To assess whether effects differed by infant sex, we conducted two sets of analyses:

1. **Sex-disaggregated analyses**: All primary analyses were repeated separately for male and female infants. Between-sex differences were tested using independent-samples *t*-tests.

2. **LME models with sex**: LME models included Sex as a fixed effect covariate along with all interactions (Condition × Block × Sex). The three-way interaction tests whether condition effects on learning differ by sex.

For all sex-related analyses, FDR correction was applied across all comparisons. Results are reported in Supplementary Table S_Sex.

#### Missing Data

Missing data arose from technical issues ([X]% of trials), infant fussiness ([X]% of sessions), or artifact rejection ([X]% of epochs). Missingness was assessed using Little's MCAR test; data were found to be missing completely at random (*χ²* = [X], *p* = [X]), justifying complete-case analysis. Sample sizes vary across analyses depending on data availability for each measure.

#### Statistical Reporting

Following Nature Communications guidelines, we report complete statistics for all tests:
- Sample size (*N*)
- Descriptive statistics (*M* ± *SD*)
- Test statistic (*t*, *F*, etc.)
- Degrees of freedom (*df*)
- Exact *p*-values (to *p* < .001)
- FDR-corrected *q*-values
- Effect sizes (Hedges' *g* or *η*²) with 95% CIs

All statistical tests were two-tailed unless otherwise specified. Significance threshold: *q* < .05 (FDR-corrected).
