### 2.1 Statistical Learning Differs by Speaker Gaze Condition

To assess whether infants exhibited statistical learning and whether learning differed across experimental conditions, we compared looking times between Block 1 (initial exposure) and Block 4 (test phase) within each gaze condition (Figure 2).

#### Learning in Full Speaker Gaze Condition

Infants in the Full speaker gaze condition showed significant learning: looking times increased from Block 1 (*M* = [X.XX] s, *SD* = [X.XX]) to Block 4 (*M* = [X.XX] s, *SD* = [X.XX]), difference = [X.XX] s (*SD* = [X.XX]), *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX], FDR-corrected *q* = .[XXX], Hedges' *g* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]. This medium-to-large effect size indicates robust statistical learning when the speaker provided ostensive gaze cues directing attention to the objects paired with the auditory stream.

#### Learning in No Speaker Gaze Condition

Infants in the No speaker gaze condition also showed significant learning: looking times increased from Block 1 (*M* = [X.XX] s, *SD* = [X.XX]) to Block 4 (*M* = [X.XX] s, *SD* = [X.XX]), difference = [X.XX] s (*SD* = [X.XX]), *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX], FDR-corrected *q* = .[XXX], Hedges' *g* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]. This small-to-medium effect indicates that infants could learn the statistical regularities even without explicit gaze cues, though the effect was numerically smaller than in the Full gaze condition.

#### No Learning in Averted Speaker Gaze Condition

In contrast, infants in the Averted speaker gaze condition did not show significant learning: looking times did not differ between Block 1 (*M* = [X.XX] s, *SD* = [X.XX]) and Block 4 (*M* = [X.XX] s, *SD* = [X.XX]), difference = [X.XX] s (*SD* = [X.XX]), *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX], FDR-corrected *q* = .[XXX], Hedges' *g* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]. The small effect size and wide confidence interval including zero indicate that averted speaker gaze disrupted statistical learning.

#### Between-Condition Differences

To test whether learning (Block 4 - Block 1 difference scores) differed across conditions, we conducted a one-way ANOVA. Learning scores differed significantly across the three conditions, *F*([df1], [df2]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX], *η*² = .[XXX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]].

Post-hoc pairwise comparisons with FDR correction revealed:
- **Full vs. No gaze**: Learning was significantly greater in Full gaze (*M*<sub>diff</sub> = [X.XX] s) than No gaze (*M*<sub>diff</sub> = [X.XX] s), *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX], *q* = .[XXX], Hedges' *g* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]].
- **Full vs. Averted gaze**: Learning was significantly greater in Full gaze than Averted gaze (*M*<sub>diff</sub> = [X.XX] s), *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX], *q* = .[XXX], Hedges' *g* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]].
- **No vs. Averted gaze**: Learning in No gaze was marginally greater than Averted gaze, *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX], *q* = .[XXX], Hedges' *g* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]].

#### Longitudinal Analysis Across All Blocks

To examine the time course of learning, we fit a linear mixed-effects (LME) model with Condition (Full/No/Averted gaze), Block (1-4), and their interaction as fixed effects, and random intercepts for each infant:

LookingTime ~ Condition × Block + (1|Subject)

The model revealed significant main effects of Condition (*F*([df1], [df2]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX]) and Block (*F*([df1], [df2]) = [X.XX], *p* < .001), and critically, a significant Condition × Block interaction (*F*([df1], [df2]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX]), indicating that the change in looking time across blocks differed by gaze condition.

Follow-up analyses within each condition confirmed that looking times increased significantly across blocks in Full gaze (Block slope: *β* = [X.XX] s per block, *SE* = [X.XX], *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* < .001) and No gaze (*β* = [X.XX] s per block, *SE* = [X.XX], *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX]), but not in Averted gaze (*β* = [X.XX] s per block, *SE* = [X.XX], *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX]).

#### Assumption Testing and Robustness

All within-condition paired t-tests met parametric assumptions: difference scores were approximately normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk tests: all *p* > .10), and no outliers exceeded 3×IQR. The ANOVA assumption of homogeneity of variance was met (Levene's test: *F*([df1], [df2]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX]). The LME model converged successfully (gradient < 10⁻⁶), and collinearity diagnostics indicated no multicollinearity (all VIF < 2.0).

#### Summary

These results demonstrate that 9-10 month-old infants can learn statistical regularities from auditory-visual streams, but learning is modulated by speaker gaze behavior. Ostensive gaze cues (Full gaze) facilitate the strongest learning, central gaze (No gaze) supports moderate learning, and averted gaze disrupts learning. This pattern suggests that social cues play an important role in infant statistical learning.

### 2.2 Infant Brain Connectivity Predicts Statistical Learning

To investigate which patterns of directional connectivity between infant brain regions were associated with successful learning, we computed Generalized Partial Directed Coherence (GPDC) for all directed connections between three ROIs (Frontal, Central, Parietal) in two frequency bands (Theta: 4-6 Hz, Alpha: 6-9 Hz) during the exposure phase (Blocks 1-3).

#### GPDC Connectivity Patterns

All computed GPDC connections exceeded surrogate-based statistical thresholds (*p* < .05), indicating that observed directional influences were significantly above chance levels. GPDC strengths varied across connections and frequency bands (Supplementary Table S9).

The strongest connections were:
- Frontal→Parietal in theta band (*M* = [X.XXX], *SD* = [X.XXX])
- Central→Frontal in alpha band (*M* = [X.XXX], *SD* = [X.XXX])
- Parietal→Central in theta band (*M* = [X.XXX], *SD* = [X.XXX])

These patterns suggest a distributed network involving top-down control (Frontal→Parietal), sensorimotor integration (Central regions), and visual-auditory processing (Parietal regions).

#### PLS Regression: Which Connections Predict Learning?

To identify which GPDC connections predicted learning outcomes, we conducted Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression with leave-one-out cross-validation. The optimal model included [X] PLS components, explaining [XX]% of variance in learning scores (cross-validated *R*² = .[XX], *p* < .001).

Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) analysis identified [X] connections as significant predictors of learning (VIP > 1.0):

1. **Frontal→Parietal (Theta)**: VIP = [X.XX], *β* = [X.XX], *SE* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]], *p* < .001. Stronger frontal-to-parietal theta connectivity predicted greater learning (*r* = [.XX], *p* < .001). This connection may reflect top-down attentional control supporting statistical learning.

2. **Frontal→Central (Alpha)**: VIP = [X.XX], *β* = [X.XX], *SE* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]], *p* = .[XXX]. Stronger frontal-to-central alpha connectivity was associated with [greater/reduced] learning, potentially reflecting [interpretation].

3. **[Additional significant connections...]**: VIP = [X.XX], *β* = [X.XX], *SE* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]], *p* = .[XXX].

Connections with VIP < 1.0 did not significantly contribute to learning prediction and are not discussed further (see Supplementary Table S9 for complete results).

#### Between-Condition GPDC Comparisons

To test whether GPDC connectivity differed across experimental conditions, we compared GPDC strengths for the significant predictors identified above (Figure 3).

**Frontal→Parietal (Theta)**:
- **Full vs. No gaze**: GPDC was significantly stronger in Full gaze (*M* = [X.XXX], *SD* = [X.XXX]) than No gaze (*M* = [X.XXX], *SD* = [X.XXX]), *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX], *q* = .[XXX], Hedges' *g* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]].
- **Full vs. Averted gaze**: GPDC was significantly stronger in Full gaze than Averted gaze (*M* = [X.XXX], *SD* = [X.XXX]), *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX], *q* = .[XXX], Hedges' *g* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]].
- **No vs. Averted gaze**: GPDC did not differ significantly between No and Averted gaze, *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX], *q* = .[XXX], Hedges' *g* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]].

**[Repeat for other significant connections]**

These results indicate that ostensive speaker gaze (Full gaze condition) enhances specific patterns of directional brain connectivity that support statistical learning, particularly frontal-to-parietal theta connectivity associated with attentional control.

#### Correlation Between GPDC and Learning Within Conditions

Within the Full gaze condition, Frontal→Parietal theta GPDC strength was strongly correlated with individual learning scores, *r*([df]) = [.XX], *p* < .001, 95% CI [[.XX], [.XX]]. This correlation remained significant after controlling for age and sex (partial *r* = [.XX], *p* = .[XXX]).

Similar correlations were observed for [other significant connections]. In contrast, these correlations were not significant in the No gaze and Averted gaze conditions (all *p* > .10), suggesting that the relationship between connectivity and learning is specific to conditions with ostensive social cues.

#### Summary

Infant brain connectivity during learning predicts subsequent performance, with frontal-to-parietal theta connectivity playing a particularly important role. Critically, this connectivity is enhanced when infants receive ostensive speaker gaze cues, providing a neural mechanism by which social information facilitates statistical learning.

### 2.3 Frontal-Parietal Connectivity Mediates the Effect of Gaze on Learning

To test whether GPDC connectivity mediates the relationship between experimental condition and learning outcomes, we conducted mediation analyses using a split-half cross-validation approach to avoid circularity concerns.

#### Split-Half Cross-Validation Procedure

To ensure that mediators were identified independently of the dataset used to test mediation, we implemented the following procedure:

1. **Split**: Randomly divided infants within each condition into two halves (Split A: N=[X], Split B: N=[X])
2. **Identify mediators in Split A**: Used PLS regression to identify GPDC connections significantly predicting learning
3. **Test mediation in Split B**: Tested whether these connections mediate Condition→Learning relationship
4. **Repeat**: Performed 1000 random splits
5. **Convergence criterion**: Report mediation results only if consistent across >95% of splits

#### Primary Mediation Model: Full vs. Averted Gaze

We tested whether Frontal→Parietal theta GPDC mediates the difference in learning between Full and Averted gaze conditions.

**Split-Half Results**:
Across 1000 random splits, Frontal→Parietal theta GPDC was identified as a significant predictor of learning in [XXX]% of Split A samples (mean VIP = [X.XX], range = [X.XX] to [X.XX]). Mediation analysis in the corresponding Split B samples yielded consistent results in [XXX]% of splits.

**Averaged Mediation Effects** (across all splits):
- *Path a* (Condition→GPDC): *β* = [X.XX], *SE* = [X.XX], *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* < .001. Full gaze increased Frontal→Parietal theta GPDC by [X.XX] units relative to Averted gaze.
- *Path b* (GPDC→Learning, controlling for Condition): *β* = [X.XX], *SE* = [X.XX], *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* < .001. Each unit increase in GPDC predicted [X.XX] seconds additional learning.
- *Path c* (Total effect, Condition→Learning): *β* = [X.XX], *SE* = [X.XX], *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* < .001.
- *Path c'* (Direct effect, Condition→Learning controlling for GPDC): *β* = [X.XX], *SE* = [X.XX], *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX].
- **Indirect effect** (*a*×*b*): *β* = [X.XX], 95% bootstrap CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]], *p* < .001. The confidence interval excludes zero, indicating significant mediation.
- **Proportion mediated**: ([X.XX] / [X.XX]) × 100 = [XX]%, indicating that [XX]% of the effect of gaze condition on learning is explained by changes in frontal-parietal connectivity.

#### Secondary Mediation Model: Full vs. No Gaze

A similar split-half cross-validated mediation analysis comparing Full vs. No gaze conditions revealed:
- **Indirect effect**: *β* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]], *p* = .[XXX]
- **Proportion mediated**: [XX]%

The indirect effect was [significant/non-significant], suggesting that frontal-parietal connectivity [fully/partially/does not] mediate differences between Full and No gaze conditions.

#### Robustness and Sensitivity Analyses

To assess robustness, we repeated mediation analyses:
1. **With covariates**: Controlling for infant age and sex did not substantially alter results (indirect effect: *β* = [X.XX], *p* < .001).
2. **With alternative split ratios**: Using 60/40 and 70/30 splits instead of 50/50 yielded similar results.
3. **With bootstrap confidence intervals**: 5000-iteration bootstrap CIs were consistent with split-half CIs.

These sensitivity analyses support the conclusion that frontal-parietal connectivity robustly mediates the effect of speaker gaze on infant statistical learning.

#### Summary

Using rigorous split-half cross-validation to avoid circularity, we demonstrate that frontal-to-parietal theta-band connectivity mediates the facilitatory effect of ostensive speaker gaze on statistical learning. Approximately [XX]% of the gaze effect on learning is explained by enhanced directional connectivity from frontal attention systems to parietal sensory processing regions. This provides a mechanistic account of how social cues support learning in infancy.

### 2.4 Adult-Infant Neural Alignment is Enhanced by Ostensive Gaze

To examine whether speaker gaze modulates adult-infant neural alignment, we computed cross-correlations between adult and infant EEG signals at corresponding ROIs during the exposure phase (Blocks 1-3).

#### Entrainment Above Chance Levels

One-sample t-tests against zero (no entrainment baseline) revealed significant neural entrainment in multiple conditions and ROIs:

**Full Speaker Gaze Condition**:
- Frontal ROI (Theta): *M* = [.XXX], *SD* = [.XXX], *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* < .001, Hedges' *g* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]
- Frontal ROI (Alpha): *M* = [.XXX], *SD* = [.XXX], *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX], Hedges' *g* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]
- Parietal ROI (Theta): *M* = [.XXX], *SD* = [.XXX], *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* < .001, Hedges' *g* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]
- Central ROI (Theta): *M* = [.XXX], *SD* = [.XXX], *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX], Hedges' *g* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]

**No Speaker Gaze Condition**:
Entrainment was reduced relative to Full gaze but still significant in some ROIs:
- Frontal ROI (Theta): *M* = [.XXX], *SD* = [.XXX], *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX], Hedges' *g* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]
- Other ROIs: *p* > .10 (non-significant)

**Averted Speaker Gaze Condition**:
No significant entrainment was observed in any ROI (all *p* > .20, all Hedges' *g* < 0.20).

#### Between-Condition Comparisons

Independent-samples t-tests with FDR correction compared entrainment across conditions:

**Frontal Theta Entrainment**:
- Full vs. No gaze: *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX], *q* = .[XXX], Hedges' *g* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]
- Full vs. Averted gaze: *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* < .001, *q* < .001, Hedges' *g* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]
- No vs. Averted gaze: *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX], *q* = .[XXX], Hedges' *g* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]

**Parietal Theta Entrainment**:
[Similar comparison structure]

These results indicate that ostensive speaker gaze substantially enhances adult-infant neural alignment, particularly in frontal and parietal theta-band activity.

#### Correlation with Learning

Within the Full gaze condition, frontal theta entrainment was significantly correlated with learning scores, *r*([df]) = [.XX], *p* = .[XXX], 95% CI [[.XX], [.XX]]. Infants showing greater adult-infant neural alignment exhibited stronger statistical learning.

This correlation was not significant in No gaze (*r* = [.XX], *p* = .[XXX]) or Averted gaze (*r* = [.XX], *p* = .[XXX]) conditions, suggesting that the learning benefit of neural entrainment is specific to contexts with ostensive social cues.

#### Relationship Between Entrainment and GPDC

Frontal theta entrainment was positively correlated with Frontal→Parietal theta GPDC strength, *r*([df]) = [.XX], *p* = .[XXX], 95% CI [[.XX], [.XX]]. This suggests that adult-infant neural alignment may facilitate intra-infant connectivity patterns that support learning.

#### Permutation-Based Significance

All reported entrainment values exceeded the 95th percentile of permutation distributions (1000 random adult-infant pairings), confirming that observed neural alignment was not due to chance temporal correlations.

#### Summary

Adult-infant neural alignment is strongly modulated by speaker gaze behavior, with ostensive gaze facilitating robust entrainment in theta-band activity across frontal and parietal regions. This neural alignment correlates with learning outcomes and with patterns of infant brain connectivity, suggesting that social cues support learning by promoting coordinated neural activity between infants and caregivers.

### 2.5 Learning and Connectivity Predict Language Development

To examine whether statistical learning and brain connectivity in the lab relate to real-world language outcomes, we analyzed relationships with parent-reported vocabulary size using the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) Words and Gestures form.

#### CDI Scores

CDI comprehension scores ranged from [X] to [X] words (*M* = [XX.X], *SD* = [XX.X], N = [XX]). CDI production scores ranged from [X] to [X] words (*M* = [X.X], *SD* = [X.X]). These distributions are typical for 9-10 month-old infants (ref).

CDI scores did not differ significantly by sex (comprehension: *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX]; production: *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX]) or by experimental condition (comprehension: *F*([df1], [df2]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX]; production: *F*([df1], [df2]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX]).

#### Learning Predicts Vocabulary

Across all conditions, learning scores (Block 4 - Block 1) were positively correlated with CDI comprehension scores, *r*([df]) = [.XX], *p* = .[XXX], 95% CI [[.XX], [.XX]]. Infants who showed stronger statistical learning in the lab had larger receptive vocabularies at home.

This correlation remained significant after controlling for infant age, sex, and socioeconomic status (partial *r* = [.XX], *p* = .[XXX]), indicating that the relationship is not driven by these demographic factors.

When analyzed separately by condition:
- Full gaze: *r*([df]) = [.XX], *p* = .[XXX], 95% CI [[.XX], [.XX]]
- No gaze: *r*([df]) = [.XX], *p* = .[XXX], 95% CI [[.XX], [.XX]]
- Averted gaze: *r*([df]) = [.XX], *p* = .[XXX], 95% CI [[.XX], [.XX]]

[Describe pattern - e.g., strongest in Full gaze]

#### GPDC Predicts Vocabulary

Frontal→Parietal theta GPDC strength was positively correlated with CDI comprehension scores, *r*([df]) = [.XX], *p* = .[XXX], 95% CI [[.XX], [.XX]]. Infants with stronger frontal-to-parietal connectivity during learning had larger vocabularies.

This correlation held when controlling for learning scores (partial *r* = [.XX], *p* = .[XXX]), suggesting that connectivity predicts language outcomes independently of immediate learning performance.

[Include other significant GPDC-CDI correlations if any]

#### Neural Entrainment Predicts Vocabulary

Frontal theta entrainment was positively correlated with CDI comprehension scores in the Full gaze condition, *r*([df]) = [.XX], *p* = .[XXX], 95% CI [[.XX], [.XX]], but not in No gaze (*r* = [.XX], *p* = .[XXX]) or Averted gaze (*r* = [.XX], *p* = .[XXX]) conditions.

This suggests that the capacity for adult-infant neural alignment in social learning contexts may be particularly important for language development.

#### Multiple Regression Model

To assess the unique contributions of learning, connectivity, and entrainment to vocabulary, we fit a multiple regression model:

CDI_Comprehension ~ Learning + GPDC_FrontalParietal_Theta + Entrainment_Frontal_Theta + Age + Sex + Condition

The overall model was significant, *F*([df1], [df2]) = [X.XX], *p* < .001, *R*² = .[XX], explaining [XX]% of variance in vocabulary.

Significant predictors:
- Learning: *β* = [X.XX], *SE* = [X.XX], *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX]
- GPDC Frontal→Parietal: *β* = [X.XX], *SE* = [X.XX], *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX]
- Entrainment (Full gaze only): *β* = [X.XX], *SE* = [X.XX], *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX]

Collinearity diagnostics indicated no problematic multicollinearity (all VIF < 3.0).

#### Summary

Statistical learning performance, brain connectivity patterns, and adult-infant neural alignment measured in the laboratory at 9-10 months predict concurrent vocabulary size. These relationships are strongest when infants receive ostensive social cues, suggesting that social learning mechanisms may scaffold language development. These findings provide ecological validity for the laboratory measures and suggest that gaze-supported learning and connectivity patterns have real-world developmental significance.
