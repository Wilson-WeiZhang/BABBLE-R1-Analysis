**Abstract**

Infants learn statistical regularities from their environment, but the neural mechanisms supporting this learning and how social cues modulate these processes remain unclear. Using dual EEG hyperscanning, we investigated how speaker gaze behavior influences statistical learning and brain connectivity in 9-10 month-old infants (*N*=47, 24 male/23 female). Infants were exposed to auditory-visual streams containing statistical regularities while an adult speaker either looked at the objects (Full gaze), maintained central gaze (No gaze), or looked away (Averted gaze). Learning was strongest with ostensive gaze cues (Full gaze: Hedges' *g*=[X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]), intermediate without gaze cues (No gaze: *g*=[X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]), and absent when gaze was averted (Averted gaze: *g*=[X.XX], *p*=.[XXX]). Critically, ostensive gaze enhanced directional brain connectivity from frontal to parietal regions in theta frequency (4-6 Hz), which predicted individual learning outcomes (*r*=[.XX], *p*<.001) and mediated the effect of gaze condition on learning (indirect effect: *Œ≤*=[X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]). Adult-infant neural alignment was also enhanced by ostensive gaze and correlated with both connectivity and learning. These neural patterns predicted concurrent vocabulary size, demonstrating ecological validity. Our findings reveal that social cues scaffold infant learning by enhancing specific patterns of brain connectivity and adult-infant neural coupling, providing a mechanistic account of how social information supports early cognitive development.

**Abstract**

Social cues like eye gaze facilitate infant learning, but the neural mechanisms underlying this facilitation remain poorly understood. We used dual EEG hyperscanning to examine how speaker gaze modulates infant brain connectivity and statistical learning. Forty-seven 9-10 month-old infants (24 male, 23 female) were exposed to auditory-visual streams with embedded statistical regularities while viewing an adult speaker who provided ostensive gaze cues (Full gaze), central gaze (No gaze), or averted gaze. Generalized Partial Directed Coherence (GPDC) quantified directional connectivity between frontal, central, and parietal brain regions. Ostensive gaze significantly enhanced frontal-to-parietal theta-band (4-6 Hz) connectivity (*t*([df])=[X.XX], *p*<.001, Hedges' *g*=[X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]), which strongly predicted learning outcomes (*r*=[.XX], *p*<.001). Split-half cross-validated mediation analysis revealed that this connectivity pattern mediated [XX]% of the gaze effect on learning (indirect effect: *Œ≤*=[X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]), indicating a mechanistic role in social learning. Additionally, ostensive gaze enhanced adult-infant neural alignment in theta frequency (*t*([df])=[X.XX], *p*<.001), which correlated with both connectivity and learning. Connectivity and entrainment patterns predicted concurrent vocabulary size, demonstrating real-world relevance. These findings provide a neurobiological mechanism for how social cues scaffold cognitive development: by enhancing specific patterns of directional brain connectivity and promoting neural coupling between infants and caregivers.

**Strengths of Version 2**:
- Emphasizes neural mechanisms and connectivity
- More technical/neuroscience-focused
- Detailed on GPDC and mediation findings
- Good for neuroscience-focused audience
- Highlights methodological rigor (split-half cross-validation)

**Abstract**

Understanding how social cues support infant learning is fundamental to developmental science and has implications for early intervention. We investigated how speaker gaze behavior modulates statistical learning, brain connectivity, and language outcomes in 9-10 month-old infants (*N*=47, 24 male/23 female). Using dual EEG hyperscanning during exposure to auditory-visual streams with statistical regularities, we found that ostensive speaker gaze (looking at objects) facilitated robust learning (Hedges' *g*=[X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]), while averted gaze disrupted learning (*g*=[X.XX], *p*=.[XXX]). Importantly, ostensive gaze enhanced specific patterns of directional brain connectivity from frontal attention systems to parietal sensory regions in theta frequency (4-6 Hz), which both predicted learning (*r*=[.XX], *p*<.001) and mediated the gaze facilitation effect (indirect effect: *Œ≤*=[X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]). Ostensive gaze also promoted adult-infant neural alignment, revealing interpersonal neural mechanisms. Critically, individual differences in learning, connectivity, and neural alignment at 9-10 months predicted concurrent vocabulary size (multiple *R*¬≤=.[XX], *p*<.001), demonstrating that these laboratory measures have real-world developmental significance. These findings reveal neurobiological pathways through which social interaction scaffolds cognitive development and suggest that atypical gaze processing or neural coupling may contribute to developmental vulnerabilities in learning and language acquisition.
