## ðŸ“‹ FIGURE 1: EXPERIMENTAL PARADIGM

**COPY THIS TEXT**:

**Figure 1. Experimental paradigm and design.** **(a)** Timeline showing the four-block structure. Blocks 1-3 served as the exposure phase during which infants viewed visual displays of two novel objects while hearing a continuous auditory stream containing statistical regularities (ABA triplets with within-triplet transitional probability = 1.0, between-triplet probability = 0.33). Block 4 served as the test phase with familiar vs. novel word-object pairings. Each block lasted [X] minutes. **(b)** The three experimental conditions differing in speaker gaze behavior. In the Full speaker gaze condition, the speaker alternated gaze between the two objects in synchrony with the auditory stream. In the No speaker gaze condition, the speaker maintained central gaze without looking at the objects. In the Averted speaker gaze condition, the speaker looked away from both objects. **(c)** Schematic of hyperscanning setup showing simultaneous adult and infant EEG recording. Adult EEG was recorded from the speaker (32 channels), infant EEG from the participant (64 channels). Three regions of interest (ROIs) were defined: Frontal (red), Central (green), and Parietal (blue). **(d)** Example stimuli showing the two novel objects and timing of gaze shifts in the Full gaze condition. Infants were randomly assigned to conditions (*n*=14-16 per condition). See Methods for complete procedural details.

**NOTES**:
- Replace [X] with actual block duration
- Adjust panel labels (a-d) if your figure has different structure
- Add more panels if needed (e.g., electrode layout, example trials)
- No statistics needed for this paradigm figure

## ðŸ“‹ FIGURE 2: LEARNING RESULTS BY CONDITION

**COPY THIS TEXT**:

**Figure 2. Statistical learning differs by speaker gaze condition.** **(a)** Looking times to test trials in Block 1 (first exposure) and Block 4 (test phase) for each experimental condition. Violin plots show the distribution of individual infant data points (dots), with boxplots indicating median (center line), interquartile range (box), and 1.5Ã—IQR (whiskers). Significant learning (increased looking from Block 1 to Block 4) was observed in Full speaker gaze (*t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX], FDR-corrected *q* = .[XXX], Hedges' *g* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]) and No speaker gaze (*t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX], *q* = .[XXX], *g* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]) conditions, but not in Averted speaker gaze (*t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX], *q* = .[XXX], *g* = [X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]). **(b)** Learning scores (Block 4 - Block 1 difference) differed significantly across conditions (one-way ANOVA: *F*([df1], [df2]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX], *Î·*Â² = .[XX]). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons with FDR correction: Full vs. No gaze: *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX], *q* = .[XXX], *g* = [X.XX]; Full vs. Averted: *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX], *q* = .[XXX], *g* = [X.XX]; No vs. Averted: *t*([df]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX], *q* = .[XXX], *g* = [X.XX]. **(c)** Longitudinal trajectory across all four blocks showing time course of learning. Lines represent group means with shaded regions indicating Â±1 SEM. A linear mixed-effects model revealed a significant Condition Ã— Block interaction (*F*([df1], [df2]) = [X.XX], *p* = .[XXX]), indicating that the change in looking time across blocks differed by gaze condition. Sample sizes: Full gaze *n*=[XX], No gaze *n*=[XX], Averted gaze *n*=[XX]. All statistical tests were two-tailed. \**p* < .05, \*\**p* < .01, \*\*\**p* < .001 (FDR-corrected). Error bars represent Â±1 SEM. See Supplementary Table S8 for complete statistics.

## ðŸ“‹ FIGURE 3: GPDC CONNECTIVITY AND LEARNING

**COPY THIS TEXT**:

---

**Figure 3. Infant brain connectivity predicts statistical learning.** **(a)** Schematic showing the six directional connections analyzed between three ROIs (Frontal, Central, Parietal) in two frequency bands (Theta: 4-6 Hz, Alpha: 6-9 Hz). Generalized Partial Directed Coherence (GPDC) quantifies the strength of directional influence from source to target region. **(b)** Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) scores from Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression predicting learning from GPDC connectivity strengths. Dashed line at VIP=1.0 indicates threshold for important predictors. Connections exceeding this threshold significantly predicted learning outcomes (leave-one-out cross-validation *R*Â² = .[XX], *p* < .001). Bars show mean VIP Â± 95% bootstrap confidence intervals (5000 iterations). Significant predictors: Frontalâ†’Parietal Theta (VIP=[X.XX], *Î²*=[X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]], *p*<.001), [additional significant connections]. **(c)** Between-condition comparisons of GPDC strength for Frontalâ†’Parietal theta connectivity (the strongest predictor identified in panel b). Violin plots show individual infant data. Full gaze showed significantly stronger connectivity than both No gaze (*t*([df])=[X.XX], *p*=.[XXX], FDR-corrected *q*=.[XXX], Hedges' *g*=[X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]) and Averted gaze (*t*([df])=[X.XX], *p*=.[XXX], *q*=.[XXX], *g*=[X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]). **(d)** Scatter plot showing the correlation between Frontalâ†’Parietal theta GPDC strength and learning score within the Full gaze condition (*r*([df])=[.XX], *p*<.001, 95% CI [[.XX], [.XX]]). Each point represents one infant. Shaded region indicates 95% confidence band. This correlation was not significant in No gaze (*r*=[.XX], *p*=.[XXX]) or Averted gaze (*r*=[.XX], *p*=.[XXX]) conditions. GPDC values averaged across Blocks 1-3 (exposure phase). All GPDC values exceeded surrogate-based significance thresholds (*p*<.05, 1000 iterations). Sample sizes: Full gaze *n*=[XX], No gaze *n*=[XX], Averted gaze *n*=[XX]. \**p*<.05, \*\**p*<.01, \*\*\**p*<.001 (FDR-corrected). See Supplementary Table S9 for complete GPDC statistics for all connections.

## ðŸ“‹ FIGURE 4: MEDIATION ANALYSIS

**COPY THIS TEXT**:

**Figure 4. Frontal-parietal connectivity mediates the effect of gaze on learning.** **(a)** Mediation model schematic showing paths *a* (Conditionâ†’GPDC), *b* (GPDCâ†’Learning), *c* (Total effect), and *c'* (Direct effect controlling for GPDC). The indirect effect (*a*Ã—*b*) quantifies the extent to which GPDC connectivity mediates the Conditionâ†’Learning relationship. **(b)** Split-half cross-validation procedure to avoid circularity: mediators identified in Split A (left) are tested in independent Split B (right). This process was repeated 1000 times with random splits. **(c)** Path coefficients from mediation analysis comparing Full vs. Averted gaze conditions. Values represent averages across 1000 splits. Path *a*: *Î²*=[X.XX], *SE*=[X.XX], *t*([df])=[X.XX], *p*<.001; Path *b*: *Î²*=[X.XX], *SE*=[X.XX], *t*([df])=[X.XX], *p*<.001; Path *c*: *Î²*=[X.XX], *SE*=[X.XX], *t*([df])=[X.XX], *p*<.001; Path *c'*: *Î²*=[X.XX], *SE*=[X.XX], *t*([df])=[X.XX], *p*=.[XXX]. **(d)** Indirect effect (mediation) with 95% bootstrap confidence interval. The indirect effect was significant (*Î²*=[X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]], *p*<.001), indicating that [XX]% of the effect of gaze condition on learning is mediated by Frontalâ†’Parietal theta connectivity. Error bars represent 95% bootstrap confidence intervals. The confidence interval excludes zero, confirming significant mediation. Mediation remained significant when controlling for infant age and sex (partial mediation: *Î²*=[X.XX], *p*<.001). This split-half cross-validated approach ensures that identification of mediators and testing of mediation occur in independent datasets, avoiding circularity concerns. Sample sizes for each split: *n*â‰ˆ[XX] per split half. See Methods for complete mediation analysis procedure.

**NOTES**:
- Replace [X.XX] with actual mediation statistics from Results 2.3
- Adjust panels to match your figure structure
- Emphasize split-half cross-validation in legend to address circularity concerns
- This directly addresses Reviewer 2 Major Issue 2.3

## ðŸ“‹ FIGURE 5: NEURAL ENTRAINMENT RESULTS

**COPY THIS TEXT**:

---

**Figure 5. Adult-infant neural alignment is enhanced by ostensive gaze.** **(a)** Schematic illustrating neural entrainment analysis. Cross-correlations at zero lag were computed between adult speaker and infant EEG signals at corresponding ROIs, separately for theta (4-6 Hz) and alpha (6-9 Hz) frequency bands. Entrainment was quantified as the difference between zero-lag and mean random-lag correlations. **(b)** Neural entrainment in each experimental condition for frontal theta-band activity. Violin plots show individual infant data. Significant entrainment above zero (dashed line) was observed in Full gaze (*t*([df])=[X.XX], *p*<.001, Hedges' *g*=[X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]) and weakly in No gaze (*t*([df])=[X.XX], *p*=.[XXX], *g*=[X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]), but not in Averted gaze (*t*([df])=[X.XX], *p*=.[XXX], *g*=[X.XX], 95% CI [[X.XX], [X.XX]]). Between-condition comparisons with FDR correction: Full vs. No: *t*([df])=[X.XX], *p*=.[XXX], *q*=.[XXX], *g*=[X.XX]; Full vs. Averted: *t*([df])=[X.XX], *p*<.001, *q*<.001, *g*=[X.XX]; No vs. Averted: *t*([df])=[X.XX], *p*=.[XXX], *q*=.[XXX], *g*=[X.XX]. **(c)** Heatmap showing entrainment values for all ROIs (rows) and conditions (columns) in theta band. Color intensity indicates strength of adult-infant correlation. Frontal and parietal ROIs show strongest entrainment in Full gaze condition. **(d)** Scatter plot showing correlation between frontal theta entrainment and learning score within Full gaze condition (*r*([df])=[.XX], *p*=.[XXX], 95% CI [[.XX], [.XX]]). This correlation was not significant in No gaze (*r*=[.XX], *p*=.[XXX]) or Averted gaze (*r*=[.XX], *p*=.[XXX]) conditions. All reported entrainment values exceeded the 95th percentile of permutation-based null distributions (1000 random adult-infant pairings), confirming statistical significance above chance. Entrainment values averaged across Blocks 1-3. Sample sizes: Full gaze *n*=[XX], No gaze *n*=[XX], Averted gaze *n*=[XX]. \**p*<.05, \*\**p*<.01, \*\*\**p*<.001 (FDR-corrected). Error bars: Â±1 SEM.

**NOTES**:
- Replace [X.XX] with actual entrainment statistics from Results 2.4
- Adjust panels to match your figure
- Emphasize permutation-based significance testing
- This addresses Reviewer 3 Comment 3.4
- If using violin plots (Editorial Requirement #3), verify text matches

## ðŸ“‹ FIGURE 6: RELATIONSHIPS WITH VOCABULARY

**COPY THIS TEXT**:

---

**Figure 6. Learning and connectivity predict language development.** **(a)** Scatter plot showing correlation between learning score (Block 4 - Block 1) and CDI comprehension vocabulary across all conditions. Pearson correlation: *r*([df])=[.XX], *p*=.[XXX], 95% CI [[.XX], [.XX]]. This correlation remained significant after controlling for age, sex, and SES (partial *r*=[.XX], *p*=.[XXX]). Each point represents one infant, colored by condition (Full gaze: blue, No gaze: orange, Averted gaze: gray). Shaded region indicates 95% confidence band. **(b)** Scatter plot showing correlation between Frontalâ†’Parietal theta GPDC strength and CDI comprehension vocabulary. Pearson correlation: *r*([df])=[.XX], *p*=.[XXX], 95% CI [[.XX], [.XX]]. This correlation remained significant when controlling for learning score (partial *r*=[.XX], *p*=.[XXX]), suggesting that connectivity predicts vocabulary independently of immediate learning performance. **(c)** Scatter plot showing correlation between frontal theta entrainment and CDI comprehension vocabulary within the Full gaze condition. Pearson correlation: *r*([df])=[.XX], *p*=.[XXX], 95% CI [[.XX], [.XX]]. This correlation was not significant in No gaze (*r*=[.XX], *p*=.[XXX]) or Averted gaze (*r*=[.XX], *p*=.[XXX]) conditions, shown in gray. **(d)** Standardized beta coefficients from multiple regression model predicting CDI comprehension from learning, GPDC, entrainment, age, sex, and condition (overall model: *F*([df1], [df2])=[X.XX], *p*<.001, *R*Â²=.[XX]). Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Significant predictors shown with filled bars, non-significant predictors with open bars. Collinearity diagnostics: all VIF<3.0. CDI scores collected via parent report using MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (Words and Gestures form). CDI data available for *n*=[XX] infants (attrition due to unreturned questionnaires). Sample characteristics: CDI comprehension *M*=[XX.X] words, *SD*=[XX.X], range=[X]-[X]; CDI production *M*=[X.X] words, *SD*=[X.X], range=[X]-[X]. These distributions are typical for 9-10 month-old infants. \**p*<.05, \*\**p*<.01, \*\*\**p*<.001.

**NOTES**:
- Replace [X.XX] with actual correlations from Results 2.5
- Adjust panels to match your figure
- Include SES information if you collected it
- This provides ecological validity (Reviewer 2 concern)
- Consider combining with another figure if space limited

**Supplementary Figure S1. Parametric assumption testing for all primary analyses.** **(a-c)** Q-Q plots showing normality of difference scores (Block 4 - Block 1) for each condition. Shapiro-Wilk tests indicated approximately normal distributions for all conditions (Full gaze: *W*=[X.XX], *p*=.[XXX]; No gaze: *W*=[X.XX], *p*=.[XXX]; Averted gaze: *W*=[X.XX], *p*=.[XXX]). Points falling along the diagonal indicate data consistent with normality. **(d-f)** Boxplots showing outlier detection using 3Ã—IQR criterion. Red points indicate outliers that were excluded from primary analyses. Number of outliers: Full gaze *n*=[X], No gaze *n*=[X], Averted gaze *n*=[X]. Analyses were conducted both with and without outliers; results did not differ substantively (see Supplementary Table S10). **(g)** Levene's test for homogeneity of variance across conditions: *F*([df1], [df2])=[X.XX], *p*=.[XXX], indicating equal variances assumption was met for ANOVA. **(h)** Residual plot from LME model showing residuals vs. fitted values. Random scatter around zero indicates adequate model fit and homoscedasticity. **(i)** Histogram of LME model residuals with overlaid normal curve. Residuals were approximately normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk: *W*=[X.XX], *p*=.[XXX]). All parametric assumptions were met, justifying use of parametric tests for primary analyses.

**Supplementary Figure S2. Sensitivity analyses and robustness checks.** **(a)** Split-half reliability of learning scores. Learning scores from odd trials correlated strongly with even trials across all conditions (*r*=[.XX], *p*<.001), indicating high internal consistency. **(b)** Leave-one-out cross-validation of PLS regression model. Cross-validated *R*Â² (blue line) vs. number of PLS components. Optimal model selected at [X] components (red dot) minimizing cross-validated prediction error. **(c)** Bootstrap distribution of indirect effect from mediation analysis (5000 iterations). Histogram shows distribution of *a*Ã—*b* values. Vertical red line indicates observed indirect effect; dashed lines indicate 95% confidence interval. Distribution excludes zero, confirming significant mediation. **(d)** Convergence of split-half mediation results across 1000 random splits. Each point represents one split. Blue region indicates splits where mediation was significant (*p*<.05); gray region indicates non-significant. Mediation was significant in [XXX]% of splits, confirming robust effect. **(e)** Forest plot showing learning effect sizes (Hedges' *g*) with and without various exclusions (no exclusions, exclude outliers, exclude participants with <70% valid trials, exclude participants with SNR<[X]dB). Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Effect sizes were consistent across inclusion criteria, indicating results are robust to exclusion decisions. **(f)** Comparison of parametric (t-test) and non-parametric (Wilcoxon signed-rank) results for learning in each condition. Both approaches yielded consistent conclusions, validating use of parametric tests.

**Supplementary Figure S3. MVAR model validation for GPDC analysis.** **(a)** Distribution of optimal MVAR model orders selected via BIC criterion. Most models selected orders between [X]-[X] (mean=[X.X], SD=[X.X]). **(b)** Whiteness of residuals: histogram of Portmanteau test *p*-values across all fitted models. Most *p*-values exceed .05 (dashed line), indicating adequate whiteness. Models failing this criterion (<5%) were excluded. **(c)** Model stability: histogram of maximum eigenvalue of companion matrix. All values <1.0 (dashed line), confirming stable models. **(d)** Consistency: scatter plot showing correlation between observed and model-predicted signals. Strong correlations (*r*>.7 for most models) indicate good model fit. **(e)** Example MVAR-predicted vs. observed time series for one representative infant. Close correspondence indicates adequate model. **(f)** Surrogate distributions for GPDC significance testing. Histogram shows GPDC values from 1000 phase-shuffled surrogates (gray) vs. observed GPDC (red arrow). Observed values exceed 95th percentile of surrogates, confirming statistical significance. These validation steps ensure that all reported GPDC values derive from adequately fitted, stable, and validated MVAR models.
