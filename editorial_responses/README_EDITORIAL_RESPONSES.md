RESPONSE TO EDITORIAL REQUIREMENTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

We thank the editors for the opportunity to revise our manuscript and have
addressed all editorial requirements as follows:

---
REQUIREMENT 1: SEX AND GENDER REPORTING
---

✅ ABSTRACT: Added statement that both sexes included, sex controlled as
   covariate, no sex-specific effects (Line 43)

✅ METHODS: Added comprehensive "Sex and gender considerations" subsection
   detailing sample composition (24M/23F), statistical approach (sex as
   covariate in all models), power analysis, and null sex effects (Lines XXX-YYY)

✅ SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS: Created Table S_Sex with complete sex-disaggregated
   statistics for all measures (learning, GPDC, entrainment, attention, CDI)

✅ SOURCE DATA: Created Source_Data_Sex_Disaggregated.xlsx with all individual-
   level data separated by sex

✅ DISCUSSION: Added paragraph on sex considerations to Limitations section,
   acknowledging power limitations and suggesting future research directions

✅ REPORTING SUMMARY: Completed Section 6 (Human Research Participants) with
   full sex/gender details

KEY FINDING: No significant sex differences or interactions in any primary
outcome (all p > .05), suggesting findings generalize across both sexes.

---
REQUIREMENT 2: DATA AND CODE AVAILABILITY
---

✅ DATA AVAILABILITY SECTION: Added immediately after Methods
   • All behavioral data publicly available on OSF (https://osf.io/[ID]/)
   • GPDC connectivity matrices publicly available
   • Neural entrainment data publicly available
   • Preprocessed EEG available with data sharing agreement
   • DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/[ID]

✅ CODE AVAILABILITY SECTION: Added immediately after Data Availability
   • All analysis code on GitHub: https://github.com/[username]/infant-neural-coupling
   • Archived version on Zenodo: DOI 10.5281/zenodo.[ID]
   • Comprehensive documentation (README, dependencies, troubleshooting)
   • MIT License for open reuse

✅ SOURCE DATA FILES: Created for all figures (Figs 2-5 + all Supplementary)
   • Excel format with multiple sheets (data, statistics, metadata)
   • All numerical data used to generate plots included

✅ DOCUMENTATION:
   • Comprehensive data dictionary with all variable definitions
   • Analysis parameters file (JSON format)
   • README files for both data and code repositories
   • BIDS-compliant organization where applicable

All repositories follow FAIR principles to maximize transparency and reproducibility.

---
REQUIREMENT 3: FIGURES - DISTRIBUTION PLOTS
---

✅ FIGURE 2: Learning results now shown as violin plots with overlaid
   box-and-whisker and all individual data points (N=42-47 per condition)

✅ FIGURE 3: Added Panel B showing distribution of GPDC AI connectivity
   values with individual participant points visible

✅ FIGURE 5: Neural entrainment bar graph replaced with violin plot showing
   full distribution of cross-correlation magnitudes

All plots now include:
• Full distribution shape (violin)
• Quartiles and median (box-and-whisker)
• Individual participant data points (jittered for visibility)
• Mean (horizontal line) and 95% CI

This enhances transparency by showing complete data distributions rather
than summary statistics alone.

---
REQUIREMENT 4: ORCID
---

✅ Corresponding author ORCID linked in submission system: [XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX]

✅ All co-authors notified and encouraged to link ORCIDs

✅ [X] of [Y] co-authors have provided ORCIDs (added to title page)

---
REQUIREMENT 5: STATISTICAL REPORTING
---

We have fully complied with Nature Communications statistical guidance:

✅ COMPLETE REPORTING: All analyses include N, M, SD, t/F, df, exact p,
   FDR-corrected q, Hedges' g, and 95% CI (see all Results sections and
   Supplementary Tables S8-S9)

✅ SENSITIVITY ANALYSES: Following Lakens (2022), we conducted:
   • Split-half cross-validation (N=100 iterations) for mediation
   • Leave-one-out analysis (N=47 iterations)
   • Alternative FDR corrections (B-H vs B-Y)
   • Non-parametric tests for robustness
   • Assumption testing (normality, outliers, collinearity)

✅ BEST PRACTICES:
   • Hierarchical testing (omnibus LME before post-hocs)
   • Exact effect sizes (Hedges' g, not approximation)
   • Bootstrap CIs (5000 iterations)
   • All code publicly available for reproducibility

See corrected analysis scripts (fs2_R1_STATISTICAL_COMPARISON_CORRECTED.m
and statistical_utilities_corrected.m) in our GitHub repository for
complete implementation.

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

Your editorial requirements are fully addressed when:

✅ All 5 documents read and understood
✅ All checklists in each document completed
✅ OSF project created with DOI
✅ GitHub repository public with Zenodo DOI
✅ Sex/gender text added to manuscript (3+ places)

## 💡 TIPS FOR SUCCESS

1. **Start with OSF/GitHub** (longest tasks)
   - Can work on while waiting for co-author responses
   - Need DOIs for manuscript text

2. **Copy-paste liberally**
   - All text is ready to use as-is
   - Modify [placeholders] with your specific info

3. **Follow checklists**
   - Each document has implementation checklist
   - Check off as you go to track progress

4. **Ask co-authors early**
   - ORCID collection takes time
   - Send email template from Document #4 immediately

5. **Test all links**
   - OSF link works
   - GitHub repository accessible
   - Zenodo DOI resolves correctly

6. **Keep organized**
   - Track which items done in each checklist
   - Save all DOIs in one place
   - Keep screenshots of successful uploads

## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I don't know which OSF option to use"
→ See Document #2, Section 1 - Option C (Hybrid) recommended

### "My GitHub repository isn't organized"
→ See Document #2, Section 4 - Complete structure provided

### "How do I create Supplementary Table S_Sex?"
→ See Document #1, Section 6 - Template with all columns/rows

### "Figures are taking too long"
→ Document #3 has MATLAB code - copy-paste and run

### "Co-authors not responding about ORCID"
→ ORCID only required for corresponding author (you!)
→ Co-authors encouraged but not mandatory
