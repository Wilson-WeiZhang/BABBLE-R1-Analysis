## DETAILED REVIEWER COMMENTS BREAKDOWN

### REVIEWER 1: Focused, Specific Concerns (3 Major Comments)

#### **Comment 1.1: Terminology "Interpersonal Coupling" (CRITICAL)**
**Core Issue:** Manuscript uses bidirectional interaction language but adult EEG was pre-recorded
- **Impact:** Title, Abstract, Throughout manuscript
- **Underlying Concern:** Ecological validity, accurate characterization of findings
- **Required Action:** Global terminology revision + discussion paragraph
- **Existing Solution:** Multiple title/abstract options in R1_MANUSCRIPT_REVISION_OPTIONS.md
- **What's Still Needed:**
  - Execute search/replace across entire manuscript
  - Draft 3 versions of discussion paragraph for author choice
  - Ensure consistency across all sections

#### **Comment 1.2: Missing Between-Condition GPDC Comparisons (CRITICAL)**
**Core Issue:** Only compared GPDC to surrogates, not Full vs Partial vs No gaze directly
- **Impact:** Can't validate gaze-specific effects on connectivity
- **Required Analysis:** Direct statistical comparison of GPDC across conditions
- **Existing Solution:** Script fs6_R1_BETWEEN_CONDITION_GPDC_COMPARISON.m exists
- **What's Still Needed:**
  - Run the script with actual data
  - Generate statistics and confidence intervals
  - Create visualization (new Supplementary Figure)
  - Write results paragraph with exact statistics
  - Interpret findings in discussion

#### **Comment 1.3: Statistical Reporting Issues (CRITICAL)**
**Core Issue:** df=98 suggests trial-level (inflated), missing complete statistics
- **Impact:** Statistical validity concerns throughout results
- **Required Fix:** Correct to participant-level df, add complete reporting
- **Existing Solution:** Script fs2_R1_STATISTICAL_COMPARISON.m exists
- **What's Still Needed:**
  - Run corrected analysis
  - Extract all statistics (t, df, p, q, d, CI)
  - Create Supplementary Table S8
  - Update all Results section statistics
  - Add Methods clarification

---

### REVIEWER 2: Comprehensive Methodological Critique (6 Major Issues + Section Comments)

#### **Major Issue 2.1: Design-Framing Mismatch (CRITICAL)**
**Core Issue:** Same as R1.1 - pre-recorded design vs bidirectional coupling claims
- **Depth of Concern:** Goes beyond terminology to theoretical interpretation
- **Implications:** Ecological validity, generalizability, theoretical contribution
- **Required Response:**
  - Acknowledge design constraint explicitly
  - Reframe theoretical claims appropriately
  - Discuss as limitation with balanced tone
  - Suggest future directions (live hyperscanning)
- **What's Still Needed:**
  - Draft comprehensive discussion section (500-800 words)
  - Provide 3 tone options (defensive, balanced, conservative)
  - Cite precedents for pre-recorded paradigms in infant neuroscience
  - Search literature for similar methodological discussions (2023-2025)

#### **Major Issue 2.2: Inappropriate Statistical Hierarchy (CRITICAL)**
**Core Issue:** Separate t-tests per condition instead of omnibus test first
- **Statistical Problem:** Violates hierarchical testing principles
- **df Issue:** df=98-99 inconsistent with N=47 (should be ~46)
- **Required Fix:** LME omnibus → post-hocs → within-condition tests
- **Existing Solution:** fs2_R1_STATISTICAL_COMPARISON.m provides LME analysis
- **What's Still Needed:**
  - Run LME analysis and extract F-statistic
  - Run post-hoc pairwise comparisons (Full vs Partial, Full vs No, Partial vs No)
  - Report both approaches (LME primary, t-tests sensitivity)
  - Add to Supplementary Table S8
  - Update Methods section with hierarchical testing description

#### **Major Issue 2.3: Circular Mediation Analysis (MAJOR CONCERN)**
**Core Issue:** PLS component optimized for learning, then used to mediate learning
- **Circularity:** Mediator constructed to predict outcome, creates target leakage
- **Impact:** Undermines causal interpretation of mediation findings
- **Required Response:**
  - Acknowledge circularity limitation explicitly
  - Perform split-half cross-validation (derive PLS on train, test mediation on test)
  - Report out-of-sample mediation effects
  - Frame as exploratory rather than confirmatory
- **Existing Solution:** fs_R1_SENSITIVITY_ANALYSES.m includes split-half validation
- **What's Still Needed:**
  - Run split-half analysis (100 iterations)
  - Calculate mean β and 95% CI across splits
  - Write Discussion paragraph acknowledging limitation
  - Add Supplementary Section on cross-validation
  - Generate figure showing distribution of β across splits

#### **Major Issue 2.4: Sample Size for Analytical Complexity (CONCERN)**
**Core Issue:** N=42 may be insufficient for complex multivariate analyses
- **Complexity:** 81 GPDC connections, PLS regression, mediation, entrainment across multiple bands/channels
- **Risk:** Overfitting, unstable results, poor generalizability
- **Required Response:**
  - Report exact number of predictors in PLS models
  - Provide power analysis for multivariate procedures
  - Conduct leave-one-out analysis to test stability
  - Acknowledge as limitation
  - Discuss how cross-validation addresses this
- **What's Still Needed:**
  - Calculate post-hoc power for PLS (R²=24.6%, N=42)
  - Run leave-one-out analysis (fs_R1_SENSITIVITY_ANALYSES.m)
  - Create figure showing stability across LOO iterations
  - Draft limitation paragraph (200-300 words)
  - Search literature for similar sample sizes in infant GPDC studies

#### **Major Issue 2.5: Incomplete Statistical Reporting (SYSTEMATIC)**
**Core Issue:** Missing exact p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals throughout
- **Examples:**
  - "corrected p < .05" instead of exact values
  - Cohen's d reported once, absent elsewhere
  - GPDC significance without exact statistics
  - PLS R² without CI
  - Neural entrainment without exact p-values
- **Required Fix:** Complete statistics for every test
- **Existing Solution:** fs_R1_COMPREHENSIVE_STATISTICS_EXTRACTION.m
- **What's Still Needed:**
  - Run extraction script for all analyses
  - Create comprehensive Supplementary Tables S8, S9, S10
  - Update Results section with exact statistics
  - Ensure every test reports: N, M, SD, t/F/Z, df, p, q, d/η², CI

#### **Major Issue 2.6: Insufficient GPDC Validation (METHODOLOGICAL)**
**Core Issue:** Key GPDC diagnostics relegated to Supplementary
- **Missing from Main Text:**
  - Model order selection justification
  - Stability analysis (eigenvalues, stationarity)
  - Residual diagnostics (whiteness, normality)
  - Robustness to alternative specifications (frequency bands, channels)
- **Required Addition:** Summary of validation in main Methods section
- **What's Still Needed:**
  - Extract GPDC diagnostics from analysis pipeline
  - Summarize in 150-200 word Methods paragraph

## STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### 1. The Terminology Issue is Central
**Both R1.1 and R2.1 identify this as critical**
- Not just semantic - affects interpretation of entire study
- Must be addressed globally and consistently
- Requires careful balance: acknowledge limitation without undermining contribution
- Opportunity to reframe as methodological strength (control) rather than weakness

### 2. Statistical Validity Concerns are Solvable
**R1.3, R2.2, R2.5 all point to same issues**
- Good news: Correct analyses already exist in code
- Problem: Wrong statistics reported in manuscript
- Solution path is clear: Run corrected scripts → Update Results → Add Supplementary Tables
- This is execution rather than conceptual challenge

### 3. Circularity Concern Requires Sophisticated Response
**R2.3 is most theoretically challenging**
- Can't simply "fix" - PLS optimization inherently involves target
- Best approach: Validate with split-half cross-validation
- Frame as exploratory finding requiring replication
- Demonstrate robustness through sensitivity analyses
- Acknowledge limitation while showing it doesn't undermine main conclusion

### 4. Sample Size Concern is Honest Limitation
**R2.4 raises valid point**
- N=42 is reasonable for infant EEG but small for high-dimensional analyses
- Can't increase sample size at this stage
- Best response: Demonstrate stability (LOO, cross-validation)
- Acknowledge as limitation
- Cite similar sample sizes in published infant GPDC studies
- Emphasize that findings replicate across two cultural contexts

### 5. Theoretical Opportunity in R3.1
**Most constructive reviewer comment**
- R3 sees potential to connect to broader theoretical frameworks
- Enactivist and dialogue models may fit better than Natural Pedagogy alone
- Opportunity to enhance contribution by expanding theoretical context
- Literature search here will strengthen discussion substantially

### 6. Gaze Structural Function is Subtle but Important
**R3.2 raises sophisticated methodological point**
- Confound between ostensive function and temporal structure
- Can't fully address without new study (mismatched A-V)
- Honest acknowledgment + future directions is appropriate
- Review stimuli for any coding of micro-behaviors (blinks, etc.)

### 7. Editorial Requirements are Straightforward
**All have clear solutions, just need execution**
- Sex/gender: Templates exist, just implement
- Data/code: Repositories need setup and DOIs
- Figures: Code provided, generate new versions
- ORCID: Administrative task
- Statistics: Addressed by corrected analyses
